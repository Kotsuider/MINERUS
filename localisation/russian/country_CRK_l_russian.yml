  CRK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "SLAVA KRIVOY! Прошлое, запятнанное кровью и травмами давно ушедшей эпохи, породило Полицейскую Республику Кривого Крюка. После того, как в 517 году пираты истребили пятую часть населения, Кривой Крюк был оккупирован Арданте. Обучение у западных советников и щедрое финансирование в конечном итоге привели к созданию одной из самых элитных сил во всем мире. После падения НПЛ и обретения независимости в 585 году нация призвала бороться с преступностью во всем мире. Даже после успеха штату по-прежнему предстоит столкнуться со страшным противником, который может находиться всего в нескольких островах от него."

  #Events
  crk.1.desc: "Formed centuries ago, the Island of Krivoy Kryuchok stood by through the thick and thin. Our island, was but a small redstone mining town, placed in the very north of the archipelago. We for a long while, had fortune, great revenue and peace. However, it all changed with the redstone mining crash of the 400's. We were struck by poverty, our people famished and our hopes dying out. Many turned to wretched ways such as piracy and crime. Many fled our nation to greener pastures. This was but a preamble to our disgrace. \n \n Countless pirate raids, poverty and sadness broke our nation. We were bound to death and suffered by its hand. It was such for decades. Until Ardante's Intervention, were we would be trained and given claws and teeth, to punish the very pirates who brought hell to us. We slowly developed a massive military force, aided by the Southern Players, and soon enough, by 550, we would have one of the most elite fighting forces in the archipelago. We were able to take revenge on those damn pirates once and for all. \n \n After defeating the wretched pirates, we would go on to plead for our independence and free will in 585, with the Revolution of Roses, which brought down Ardantean occupation in a peaceful manner, making us able to reconcile with our masters only a few years after our independence. \n \n And now, we are in the current day. Our nation grew prosper after the late 500's, we recovered from the scars of the past. But, things are not going so well. A mysterious rumored crime syndicate has been targeting the innocence of the Overworld, our agencies are rivaling each other and Ardante's merciful hand has slowly gone numb. We are not lost. We are the hope of the Northeast, and the overworld. Slava Krivoy!"
  crk.2.desc: "Our agency runs on the fundamentals of internal elections and a restrictive republic. Our soldiers and public officers of the island choose representatives for each Agency, and said representatives elect the leaders of their respective agencies. As of now, we have long been ruled by two leaders; Katerina Rossi and Grazziani. They have held a firm hand in our politics and power in the overworld, however, this might soon change. \n \n With the implementation of Katerina's peaceful rethoric and her backroom deals with politicians and representatives, she has stablished an edge of power over Grazziani, essentially causing a power unbalance between both agencies. This has caused widespread rivalry between both agencies, with many Spetsian Units calling out KSO-6 Units and vice-versa. This lack of unity has proven destructive, as we cannot afford being divided in such times of uncertainty."
  crk.3.desc: "Disappearances, a growing weapons market and drug smuggling. All of those factors have tipped us off to something macabre happening somewhere in the overworld or even in the archipelago. Rumors of a 'Busan' or 'Deividson" syndicate or criminal organization has propped up. Their location is unknown, as there have been crimes happening worldwide that are connected to their doings. Most sinesterly, they might actually be right below our noses, operating in our archipelago. \n \n Regardless of what happens, we will work day and night to solve this mystery and figure out where these rascals are hiding. We will wipe any and all crime out from this world we very so much adore."
  crk.4.desc: "The time has come! The long-waited internal elections of 648 have begun! Our presidential candidates are many; Makarov, Katerina, Grazziani (Both Katerina and Grazziani running on their second term!), Gabriella and Fernando are disputing the title of leader for their agencies. Many specialists theorize Grazziani will lose the elections, as his accomplishments have been overshadowed by Rossi's. However, many conservatives have rallied behind him, calling out the policies by Katerina as uneffective and treacherous as they go against the fundamentals of the State, that of killing and defeating criminals at all costs. \n \n The outcome of thes elections is uncertain! Who shall win the title of leader? Only time will tell."
  crk.5.desc: "The elections have ended. In a not-so-surprising outcome, Katerina Mazzocante has been elected the head of the KSO-6 once again! Meanwhile, Grazziani was deposed by popular vote and replaced with his more famous counterpart; Makarov, who has done much for the Police State and has ran many succesful operations in the Archipelago and Overworld. \n \n The general opinion of the population over this election was mixed, with many conservatives angry over the victory of the Matryoshka and the deposal of Grazziani. In the other hand, many of the civilian population have praised the Matryoshka and Makarov, open to their new polices and government. \n \n Anyways, regardless of these results, we may continue united and keep on bearing the torch of justice in the overworld. Slava Krivoy!"
  crk.6.desc: "This cannot be a coincidence. We have been able to tie several crimes and occurances throughout the overworld to a single group or organization. A potential criminal enterprise, or family, or godamn cabal! They go by the presumed name of "Deividson" or "Busan", but nothing is really confirmed. These names could tie said organization to either somewhere in the Deep south or the west, but many of our investigators and detectives have theorized of their main base of operations being right on our doorstep; the Aecor Archipelago. \n \n These mysterious criminals have caused chaos and destruction in several spots of the overworld, specially in some western ports. These macabre individuals will be punished once we find them, and will meet our flame of justice. We will destroy these lousy bastards, no matter what!"
  crk.7.desc: "It has been revealed. The mystery that has haunted us for so long, has finally shed its ugly head. The Criminal Enterprise; now revealed as the 'Dawson Syndicate' has finally been unveiled by our massive investigation of their operations. Scarily enough, they were right below our noses! On the presumed pirate-controlled Grogger's Dawn. We were deceived for DECADES! \n \n But now, the time has come. We will begin preparations and organize our forces to invade and DESTROY this syndicate. To victory brothers! We will shine justice in those villains' faces!"
  crk.8.desc: "The governemt of Krivoy Kryuchok has asked us for the Marshall's Island, a small and mostly uninhabited isle off our main HQ. If we are to give them such concessions, we might lose strategical advantages for the north. However, they aided us in the battle against crime in this region. Its really up to our altruism."
  crk.9.desc: "The Red Isle Penitentiary has of now accepted our request on taking control of their small western island. We have renamed its names and sites to krivoyan names and we will start gradually populating the island. Slava Krivoy!"
  crk.10.desc: "Red Isle has denied our request on seizing Marshall's Island. Upmostly unfortunate, but it was worth asking them."
  crk.11.desc: "We have done it. As the last remnants of the Shadow Forces and as the last of the Dawson Family have been put under police custody, we installed our banners upon Grogger's Dawn. As the wind of Marre mountain whistles our name throughout the Isle, we stand proud. Our victory over crime has been set. \n \n From now on, this day where we stomped these demons on the northeast shall be proclaimed the day of our victory. We are the Hope of the Northeast, and the hope of the Overworld. §YSLAVA KRIVOY!§!"
  crk.12.desc: "It has come to our attention that the Miners of the Kibo and Kuroi-Ishi Coal Mining Sites have launcher a full-on strike, refusing to work and straight out protesting against the low-pay of the profession after a recession in the Coal Trade. The climax of said protest was reached when the Miners burnt down the massive National Coal Stash of Zhintao, causing massive clouds of smoke and even slightly lowering the temperatures of the neighboring region. §OThis is a great opportunity to launch a 'pacifying' operation in Zhintao and expand our reach with their political mayhem.§!"
  crk.13.desc: "It has come to our attention that the Miners of the Kibo and Kuroi-Ishi Coal Mining Sites have launcher a full-on strike, refusing to work and straight out protesting against the low-pay of the profession after a recession in the Coal Trade. The climax of said protest was reached when the Miners burnt down the massive National Coal Stash of Zhintao, causing massive clouds of smoke and even slightly lowering the temperatures of the neighboring region. This has proven insanely damaging to our industry and politics. \n \n This Crash has trully taken a toll in our economy and the coal market might not be the same for a long while. This is truly a disaster of unprecedented scale!"
  crk.14.desc: "We have received letters of the Krivoy Kryuchok Military Republic, demanding our vassalization in order to peacekeep our territories and further investigate the effects of the great coal burning. This is an outrageous request which would be met by an overwhelmingly negative reaction from the population, but would prompt the strongest military in the Archipelago to initiate a forceful invasion of our territories."
  crk.15.desc: "It has come to our attention a terrible occurance has happened in one of our most important Govermnental buildings! A bunch of heavily armed gunmen arrived at the Pelermian Town Hall and took several hostages, including our Prime Minister. After for which we were able to succesfully disable and arrest under Benextian Custody. This has shaken our population and now we are investigating the men behind this terrorist attack. We have called several Krivoyan Investigators to aid us."
  crk.16.desc: "Krivoy has recently reached out to us demanding our vassalization in order to contain terrorism in our island. If we are to accept, we will be directly protected by the Military of the Military Republic of Crooked Hook and will be left autonomous to lead our own path. But, if not, we might face §zserious consequences§!. \n \n What shall we do now?"

  #Character Descriptions
  CRK_rossi_desc: "§OЧтобы победить ненависть, отвечайте на неё любовью.§! \n \n Катерина Маззоканте Росси лидер, и по совместительству главное лицо в Кривоянской Полицейской Республики. Under the KSO-6 group, Katerina rules the nation with a perhaps unconventional concept for a police state. Utilizing of ideals such as re-education over punishment, forgiveness and mercy, Katerina leads the island with a philanthropic approach. \n \n Born in 608 from a medium-class family in Krechenia (Novgoroi District), Katerina had a steadfast motivation to join the Krivoyan SPETSIA-GRU since childhood. After graduating from high-school in 629, Rossi would immediately move on her own to Villova and join the Shadow Daggers Military Academy. After completing her basic training, she'd first serve in 634 during operation 'Dawn', where she fought a group of rogue pirates who had launched a raid in the Benextian countryside. During the skirmish, she'd do a bold move by infiltrating the pirate ranks and assassinating one of their main captains. This would grant her the 'Medal of Pride', one of the most prestigious decorations of Spetsia. \n \n One thing leads to another and Katerina would be invited by the then head of the KSO-6, Dmitri Benito, to join the upper-echelons of the organisation in 641. Katerina accepted the invite and in a short few years, would become the leader of the KSO-6. Her philantrophic approach when it comes to criminals and blatant populism has been widely criticized by the most conservative, and it's rumoured she commited to several scummy ways and practices to reach her position such as fragging officers and laundering funds out of Spetsia. However, among prisoners and civilians alike, she's a loved figure. Her mercy and forgiveness would grant her the title of 'Matryoshka'. \n \n Currently, she aims to take down the Dawson Syndicate, through a more peaceful approach. Said way of combating the syndicate is unpopular among the ranks of Spetsia and even some echelons of KSO. Will the Mother keep its sons safe from the hands of crime, or will she drive the country into degeneracy? Only time will tell."
