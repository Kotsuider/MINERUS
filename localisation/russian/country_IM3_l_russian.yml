   IM3_frank_von_herrsoch: "Франк Вон Герцог"
    IM3_frank_von_herrsoch_leader_desc: "Sir Frank von Herrsoch is the colonial administrator of New Zachzen and hails from the Imperian province of Brysse. Being of noble blood, Frank has lived his entire life within the upper class of Imperian society. He prefers to rule through pragmatism, but holds a distaste for socialism and its promises of a workers' paradise. Von Herrsoch's rule has been stable, but that can quickly change. Considering Imperia's situation at home, New Zachzen's governor will have to make a choice that will impact the colony for many years to come. Seeing the storm that is forming on the horizon, one cannot help but ask: How much of a pragmatist is Frank von Herrsoch really?"

    IM3_maria_venzerosch_leader_desc: "§1Once again we will start our story anew.§! \n \n Maria Herlock Venzerosch is a former Imperian Commander, now set to overlook the newly-found territories. Born in 610 in the city of Tasea, she was caught up by the fervorous military spirit of the newly-formed Northern Imperian Military District (NIMD). Joining the military at only 18, she worked as a supply guard at the war against the Socialist Guerrillas. She would face combat at 20, when her camp was raided by a group of Anarchist Mercenaries. While most of her camp was slaughtered, she was able to make it out alive. She would later on become a frontline soldier at age 24, serving in the infamous Kaiserlich divsion of Reinfrath Lecksmark, participating in the raid of several socialist outposts; §ther participation in the Massacre of Elysium has been rumored.§! At age 28, for her strenuous time fighting the socialist guerrillas, she would be promoted to a commander. \n \n However, not long after this promotion, she'd be sent to the northeastern colonies after a crisis in the Wache des Kolonie command structure. And now, this is where she stands. Her current activity in the colony is more-or-so political than military. She has for long disliked the way the colony has been led, being an outspoken critic of Frank von Herrsoch, claiming the colony should project 'Imperian Superiority' across the northeast. Her current motivations and goals are not quite unknown, but the settlers hope the best, specially now that the colony has lost almost all contact with Celenia Stadt."

 ###Events###
  ##Event Category##
   im3.1.desc: "Silence. \n \n All what was heard in the council room. The Imperian Civil War had begun, the Colony was in havoc. What shall we do now? How will we proceed? A wave of concerned citizens yelled those words. Under pressure, heat and madness, our leader stroke their pen upon the papers laid before him, written by the Kolonialkabinet, to sign the declaration of independence of our island. After years of slowly drifting alway from the Metropolis, we are finally free. \n \n We are not out to claim our OWN destiny. Our OWN ideals. Not bound to some Empire who barely contacts us. This is the start of a new age."
   im3.2.desc: "The colony of Neuer Zachzen. Nestled among the crowd of other islets in the Aecor Archipelago, the mountainous and dense biome of this island tells a long story. \n \n Founded in the early 400's, the island Colony of Neuer Zachzen was first-found and named by Admiral Herenburg Karosch, who was sent in an expedition to the northeast by the Celenian Navy. The colony started off as a redstone mining Colony, but along time, the Colony was made a settler-colony as it'd serve as a home for Imperian redstone miners who'd seek riches in Ardante. \n \n Imperia for long paid its citizens to populate the Area, and it had worked for a long time. But with Imperia's Saheritan Wars and social unrest, the island has been left underfunded, undersupplied and forgotten by the mainland. This lack of interactions with the Colony proves to be benefitial to an ever-growing Freedom rhetoric being built up in New Zachzen. Will we see an independent New Zachzen any time soon, or is it just gonna stay as a mere projection of Imperian power in the farthest reaches of the Overworld?"
   im3.3.desc: "The loss of contact with the Metropolis came along gradually. As players started to settle Neuer Zachzen, the settling project made by the Kingdom turned out costly in the long run. In spite of that fact, Imperia believed that stablishing the colony would be beneficial for Imperian influence in the east. So, for several after the conquest of Neuer Zachzen money was funneled into the project, with thousands upon thousands of players moving to the island and creating families, businesses and whole new lives. Heinrichstadt and Rexstadt were the first cities to be founded, with the other settlements being created later on. Bauermann's Insel was strictly prohibited entrance, due to its dangers and wildlife, but it didn't stop a few players to found minor villages and outposts in the islet. \n \n For centuries, the colony would be slowly colonized by Imperians of all states of the kingdom. Brysse, Zachzen, Weamer, Northern Minor Kingdoms, Vaxtar and Celenia, a mix of all those cultures would turn it into a true Melting Pot. Along this, was formed the Kolonialabteilung, regiment made to guard the Island, composed of several Imperian-born Saheritan Soldiers and from various places of the uniting kingdom. The Kolonialkabinet, a governmental organ was also formed for the island, comprising of a council that voted on decisions and laws for the Colony, making it easier for Imperia to take care of the far away island. This would be the peak of the colony. \n \n During 550 up until now, the Colony started being negligized and the settler project slowly began to die out. The Second Saheritan War, the Tarim Conflict and political crisis of Imperia handicapped the Metropolis of managing a colony so far away from home. And besides, it was way more lucrative to focus on the younger and more easily-accessible legation cities in Haven. By 630-640 the settler program was basically defunct and the only new colonists that'd be sent were either exiled players, prisoners, diplomats and a few miners (Which were mostly sent by Private Mining Companies). The Colony alongside it's Guarding force was also severely defunded and gave a sense to its people that they had been forgotten by Imperia. \n \n In the eyes of most nations of the Archipelago, the Colony is a mere a dead project that can't really survive in the current geopolitical state of the Northeast and the Overworld. But some tend to disagree with that. Nationalists and Conservatives such as Maria and the current governor think the Colony is an embodiment of Imperian Might itself. The fate of the colony is in dire straits. Will it face foreign conquest or rebrand itself to something greater? Only time will tell."
   im3.4.desc: "In Consequence of the political crisis that the island is undergoing, Frank Von Herrsoch, with support of the Kolonialkabinet, has decided to leave his Colonial governor duties Behind, returning to his homeland of Brysse. But, before signing the documents to retreat from Neuer Zachzen, he had appointed one of the generals of the Kolonialabteilung, Maria Venzerosch, as the new Governor of the colony. With this unexpected turn of events, the citizens are now eager to see how the Nationalist Maria will lead New Zachzen from now on. May luck be with her."
