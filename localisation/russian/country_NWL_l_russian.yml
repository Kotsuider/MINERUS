   NWL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "THE NORTH HELD! Northwall was born from the remnants of the Eastern Kingdom's northern armies, who defended the local settlers from the evil monster hordes of the Cohort. With the help of Ardante, we successfully established our own nation next to our now-famous fortline. Our government has changed over time and is now nothing more than a puppet to Ardante's will. Various groups seek to oppose this status quo, but who will walk away victorious?"

 ###Characters###
  ##Leaders##
  NWL_ian_kladair: "Айан Кладаирко"
  NWL_ian_kladair_leader_desc: "Ian Kladair is a member of the relatively small Northwallian nobility as well as being the house speaker of the Northwallian parliament. Growing up in a wealthy family gave Ian plenty of oppertunities to earn a good living, but he instead threw it all away in one grand bid for politics. Having been in the Northwallian political scene since his 20s, Sir Ian Kladair knows the the ins and outs of governance and is a king of pragmatism. He maintains close ties with Ardante to keep Northwall stable and secure. The army might prefer re-unification with the Eastern Kingdom and the people might be tired of being puppets of foreign empires, but to mr Kladair: pragmatism is king. He is nowhere near as fanatical as his main opponents, but he knows things that they do not. All of this, from pure experience of course."
  NWL_experienced_politician: "Experienced Politician"
  NWL_george_moorson: "Джордж Мурсон"
  NWL_george_moorson_leader_desc: "George Moorson is the most vocal opponent of Ian Kladair's government and a self proclaimed 'man of the people'. Having grown tired of the Northwallian government's willingness to sell the nation to foreign empires, George took it upon himself to tell the people what he perceives as the ultimate truth. According to mr Moorson, there is only one path that can lead Northwall to a peaceful existence without endless bickering: steering it away from any forms of foreign influence. A popular speaker among the common masses of Northwall, George Moorson is known for doing fiery speeches in front of cheering crowds. Will the people finally get a choice in how they are ruled?"
  NWL_villagist_revolutionary: "Вилладжисткий революционер"
  NWL_christopher_gravedigger: "Кристофер Могильщик"
  NWL_christopher_gravedigger_leader_desc: "A military man, from a military family. Christopher Gravedigger earned his position of High Commander through hard work and determination. Like a lot of militaristic youth, Christopher admired the might of the once glorious Eastern Kingdom. He read many books about its vast army and its status as the greatest military power that ever existed in the overworld. Now, he believes that it is time that Army Group North finally rejoins with the rest of the kingdom and pledges its sword to the one true government of the east. Treason and disloyalty were never a problem for the proud Eastern Kingdom. Christopher Gravedigger will be the one to tell the Eastern King the happy news: 'the northern front held, my liege'."
  NWL_eastern_loyalist: "Восточный лоялист"
  NWL_jake_middler: "Джейк Миддлерко"
  NWL_jake_middler_leader_desc: "Jake Middler is a Northwallian miner who wants the country to return to its roots. Back in the days of the frontier, farmers and miners ruled over the land now owned by the central government. Those farmers and miners now have to tolerate rich landowners owning what was once their rightful property. Jake has been a member of the social-agrarian party for a while now and he believes that the working class of Northwall deserves to be given back the land that is rightfully theirs. Bread, land and gold for the people of Northwall! Those are the promises of Middler and the social-agrarians."
  NWL_frank_leedar: "Фран Леедар"
  NWL_frank_leedar_leader_desc: "Frank Leedar. An elitist, a hated man and someone who you don't want to anger. With the exit of Ian Kladair from Northwallian politics, Frank is left to pick up the pieces. Together with his rich and powerful friends, he rules Northwall with an iron fist. A country for the elite, who would have thought that it would be possible? Frank did. That is why he is in power and the people are not."
  NWL_hated_elitist: "Ненавистный элитист"
  NWL_lord_shariff: "Темный Лорд Шарифф"
  NWL_lord_shariff_leader_desc: "Dark Lord Shariff or Nathaniel Shariff is the leader of the infamous "mountain boys" cult. They are a group of Herobrine-ist cultists that pose as bandits in the mountainous areas of Northwall. They use the terrain to ambush and kill suspected Notchists while also kidnapping some to be held for ransom. Lord Shariff is a wanted individual and has only been seen by eye witnesses during violent robberies or murders. During the turmoil, he took power using schemes and deceit. Now, he rules over the territory that he once prowled. Watch out Notchists, for Dark Lord Shariff will hunt you all down and leave your bodies to rot. ALL HAIL LORD HEROBRINE!"

  NWL_ellie_mallot: "Элли Маллот"
  NWL_ellie_mallot_leader_desc: "Miss Mallot is a hard working woman. She owns her own farm (a rare sight nowadays) and works the land when she is not out campaigning against Ian Kladair and the rest of the Northwallian nobility. She leads the Northwallian social-agrarian party and promises much. While Ellie is a favorite among the lower classes, the rich and powerful would rather see her gone. Can she keep herself standing in a political landscape where the powers that be may finally lose their grip?"

 ###Events###
  ##Event Category##
 nwl.1.d: "This beautiful country of ours has gone through quite a lot in the last 150 years. From being seperated from the rest of the Eastern Kingdom to the defeat of Herobrine's Cohort and the rise of another. Our country has over time been taken over by rich landlords and elitist families who do not share power. Villagist revolutionaries like George Moorson have been gaining popularity fast while the military and the agrarians bide their time. We survived Herobrine's invasion and we have managed to keep whatever remains of his cronies at bay. Fortune favours the bold, but who is the bravest amongst us here?"
 nwl.2.d: "The army is known to be a breeding ground for re-integrationist rhetorics and ideas. Many of these soldiers are descendants of those that fought Herobrine many years ago. They know what their great grandparents went through and they seek to restore the Eastern Kingdom to its former glory. Some doubt whether this would solve anything or if it even has any positives. The people would rather listen to screaming revolutionaries, but a true soldiers seeks to do their duty. Just who is this duty done for, according to the army?"
 nwl.3.d: "George Theodore Moorson is famous across the world for being a true villagist revolutionary. Hailed by villagists across the world as a visionary, his books sell like hotcakes and his speeches are known far and wide. However, Mr Moorson is hated by the local Northwallian elite, who would rather see him dead in a ditch. Moorson would become a legendary figure if he were to successfully overthrow the current government, so let's make sure that he will go down in the pages of history as one of the many people that died trying."
 nwl.4.d: "Another day, another protest. The countryside of Northwall is rife with socialists trying to pick fights with the police. The rich landlords hold the majority of the influence here. To make sure that their estates do not get vandalized, they hire mercenaries to keep order. The government has denounced this practice multiple times, but the rich do not seem to care. Most say that rural areas are supposed to be nice to visit, but this place seems to be an exception."
 nwl.5.d: "Northwall has approached us with a request for help. They are currently suffering from several political revolts and are begging us to put them down. Parliament is extremely divided on the issue but a decision will have to be made."
 nwl.6.d: "Ardanté has approved our request for aid. Already we are seeing several riots and protests die down thanks to the help of Ardantian soldiers. Our governemnt can now work on consolidating power and restoring the natural order of things."
 nwl.7.d: "Ardanté has responded with disgust to our request for help. It seems that they are not willing to send forces down to help. With this news, many in government have chosen to flee or protect themselves. This will likely mark the end of the Kladair administration."
 nwl.8.d: "Now that the government is on the verge of collapse, a power struggle has broken out between the three major groups. The villagists, nationalists and the socialists all want to take power for themselves. Only one of them gets to walk away victorious"
 nwl.9.d: "Something very strange has happened. The Northwallian government to our north has been overthrown by a Herobrine-ist cult from the mountains. They have approached us with an offer of unification, should we trust them?"
 nwl.10.d: "After the speech fiasko, the country is riddled with villagists looking to gain the right to vote. The other groups within Northwall are scared that they might miss out, so we could potentially use them to stave off a villagist victory. Though, is the risk worth the reward?"
 nwl.11.d: "The military has gained a lot of popularity from the parades in the big cities. Now they are storming key government buildings, with little regard for the opposition. The other groups fear a military takeover just as much as we do, so perhaps some deals can be made?"
 nwl.12.d: "for days the socialists have been marching through the countryside, demanding more influence within Northwallian politics. The elite fear that their estates will be attacked while the other 2 groups are suspicious of the social-agrarians. If we can find common ground with one of them, then we may be saved."
 nwl.13.d: "The trial had been going on for a couple days now. Evidence had been presented by both sides and court was about to make the big decision. Ian Kladair, now a prisoner of the new socialist government, argued that this was a sham trial designed to rile up the masses. The new government argued that Kladair was an enemy of the people and thus must be punished. The verdict is almost here. The judge slams his first on the table and says:"
 nwl.14.d: "A man walks into the throne room wearing a shiny military uniform. Everyone seems surprised by the man, considering he has an eastern accent but is not known by anyone. He then begins to speak. He talks about the second unification war and about how our northern armies somehow survived. This is great news and the man suggests an immediate reunification. The question is: how do we envision this reunification to go?"
 nwl.15.d: "A military fleet arrived in the port of Krinios today. With this fleet were multiple high ranking commanders who claim to hail from our northern armies. They talk about how our northern frontier survived and wish to reunify with us. This is exciting news, but how do we make sure such a unification goes according to our plans?"
 nwl.16.d: "We must make a decision on what to do with our southern neighbours. Keeping them out using the fortline has worked for years, but some within our government are suggesting taking a more aggressive stance. They are looking to you to break the stalemate, so what will it be?"
 nwl.17.d: "We have successfully beaten the bandits and are now in control of the entire region. This is an amazing day for Notchists across the overworld!"
 nwl.18.d: "We have been defeated. Our expedition has been slaughtered and the bandits are celebrating their disgusting victory. The Northwallian people are extremely upset and riots have broken out across the country. Can this possibly get any worse?"
 nwl.19.d: "Our expedition was partially successful, but was forced to turn around after some expected problems appeared. We are not defeated, but also not victorious."
 nwl.20.d: "We have successfully held out against the Northwallian attack on our territory. Those Notchist dogs expected to crush us and instead we killed them all and sent the rest running home. RUN FASTER NORTHWALLIANS!"
 nwl.21.d: "They have broken through our defenses. The Notchists have seized vast amounts of land and our leader has gone missing. This may be the end of us. May Herobrine save our souls, lads!"
 nwl.22.d: "The Notchist expedition has turned around. They were doing well initially, but we managed to force them into an orderly retreat from our territory. While this is not a victory, it certainly isn't the end for us either."
