  RED_leopold_hellforge: "Leopold Hellforge"
  RED_leopold_hellforge_political_desc: "Leopold Hellforge is the chief redstone engineer of Redstone Mountain. He is known to be kind of heart while also demanding perfection from his underlings. He serves Redstone Mountain with great pride, knowing that the redstone flows and that the machines keep churning."
  RED_chief_engineer: "Chief Engineer"
  RED_united_redstone_guilds: "United Redstone Guilds"
  RED_united_redstone_guilds_leader_desc: "The United Redstone Guilds are the cogs that keep the society of Redstone Mountain running. Split across the two inhabited mountains as well as the settled parts outside of it, the guilds are a core part of life within this unique nation. There are a grand total of ten guilds, each specialized in their own unique job, element or theme. Any citizen of Redstone Mountain is legally required to be a member of one of these ten guilds, else they will find themselves challenged both socially and economically. The guilds take care of their members and help to ensure that the machine of society will continue to keep running no matter what. Some guilds are more popular than others, but all guilds are considered equal within the eyes of the law. Most if not all guilds are in favour of the current isolationist policies, so it would take a truly earthshattering event for this to change. Redstone Mountain is a well-oiled machine that completely relies upon the hoarding and export of the mythical redstone dust. They pretty much own the redstone trade and are experts when it comes to automation. Magnificent, isn't it? Who knew how much change could happen from a collection of red dust in a rock?"
  RED_redstone_masters: "Masters of Redstone"
