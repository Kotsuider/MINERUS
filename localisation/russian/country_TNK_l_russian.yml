   TNK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "¡VAMOS! Социальное королевство Арданте — государство с социальной формой монархии, сформировавшаяся в 4 веке среди северо-восточной лихорадки красного камня. Столкнувшись с трудностями и невзгодами, через пиратство Золотого века, Вторую объединительную войну и бесчисленные кризисы. Хотя мы являемся региональным гегемоном, наша нация нестабильна. С наплывом южных иммигрантов и компаний, отсутствием лидерства у Гонсало и политической фракционностью мы можем быть обречены. Сможет ли Арданте пережить предстоящие трудные времена? Известно одному лишь Нотчу."

   delgado_leader_desc:0 "Гонзале Делгадо пришёл к власти после своей службы после третьего вторжения бандитов в 636 году.  Сражаясь на передовой Херона, поговаривают, что он поймал крипера, зажёг его, и сбросил в окопы к бандитам, что спасло жизнь волонтёрсокму легиону Южной Империи игроков, this triumph, he would forge a connection with a member of the Mountbatten family that would begin a masterful political career.\n\nWithin the newly formed Socialist State of Ardante, Gonzalo Delgado would begin working in the Foreign Affairs office. With his important friendship, he would begin to strike deals with the South, renegotiating the Redstone Agreements bringing huge profits, and assisting with the demobilization of Northwall and Ardante following the Third Bandit Incursion. This would bring him to lead a successful election campaign to become the Foreign Affairs Minister of Ardante. His work would lead to the Bucharat Concordat, a major agreement unifying the nations of the mainland Northeast (Northwall, Ardante and Blue Stone).\n\nThese achievements would earn him the nickname ‘El Gobernador’ (The Governor) and it would stick."

   ###Events###
    tnk.1.d: "Formed out off a Redstone Rush in 365, the Social Kingdom of Ardante is the biggest Social-monarchy that still exists in the Overworld. Our politics are unique, we are a Social-Monarchy with a democratic system! Therefore, we have elections, which are held on an almost yearly basis. Nowadays, after succesfully fighting the cultist invasion and the pirate golden era in the Northeast, we're the Regional Hegemony that oversees the archipelago and its matters. \n \n The Election of 648 shall be held in early january of this year! It will decide our governants and the path of our whole civilization. Who shall win? Let's wait and see! Best of luck."
    tnk.2.d: "As the ballots came in, and the population awaited in enthusiasm, the radio had announced the winner. And it was a..."
    tnk.5.d: "As the mighty Southern battleship "Craftia" arrived in the docks of Madroza, the population eagerly awaited the Southern Countess Victoria, who had announced her travel to the Social Kingdom weeks prior. As her figure descended from the deck, protected by the most elite soldiers of the Southern Player Empire, her iconic red dress wavered in the wind. The citizens of the region threw roses at her, shouting compliments and screams of happiness. \n \n As the day dragged on, Victoria proceeded to hold a speech, which whilst brief and quite improvised, still inspired the people of Madroza and Ardante; a shining example of socialist brotherhood. The visit had been a success, and the people, were joyous, such was Gonzalo."  
    tnk.3.d: "It is time for yet another election! The candidates are tightly matched, between Juan's Coallition of Constitutionalists, Garcia's Union and the Camarilla, who shall win this hectic dispute? Only Ardantean Democracy can tell!"
    tnk.4.d: "As the ballots came in, and the population awaited in enthusiasm, the radio had announced the winner. And it was a..."
    tnk.6.d: "Stormy Clouds and Fog littered the skies and streets of Madroza. Gonzalo rushed to the Madroza docks, as he had received a letter from a certain individual, that swore that his reign would end, earlier in the morning. 'Why is this happening? Who is behind this!', Gonzalo yelled in the back of the horse of one of the royal soldiers. \n \n As Gonzalo arrived at the docks, right before he embarked in his ship to Herring, shots pierced through the dimming fog of Madroza, taking out several royal soldiers. As Delgado looked back in awe, a mysterious figure appeared before his eyes. 'Well my Majesty... It seems your reign of hedonism and amenities has come to an end.'. What happens next is..."
    tnk.7.d: "Recently we've got an envoy from Ardante demanding our vassalization and integration into the Republic. If we are to refuse, we will face possible annihilation from the Ardantean Military. Otherwise, we could accept and become a puppet to their will. What shall we do?"
    tnk.8.d: "We've received an envoy from Ardante demanding our annexation and integration into the republic. If we refuse, we will possibly enter in conflict with the Republic. Otherwise, we could simply accept and join its territories. Though we should stand up for ourselves. What will we do in these troubling times?"
    tnk.9.d: "We've received an envoy from Ardante demanding our annexation and integration into the Kingdom. If we refuse, we will possibly enter in conflict with the Kingdom. Otherwise, we could simply accept and join its territories. Though we should stand up for ourselves. What will we do in these troubling times?"
    tnk.10.d: "Part of their new campaign of monster clan integration, we've received an envoy from Ardante demanding our integration into the republic as one of the autonomous clans. If we refuse, we will possibly enter in conflict with the Republic. Otherwise, we could simply accept and join its territories."  
    tnk.11.d: "We've received an amazing envoy from Ardante that invites us into their monster-clan autonomous region experiment! It's almost like a dream come true! We'll finally be able to live with players. If we refuse, we will possibly lose this great opportunity forever. Otherwise, we could do the right thing and join up!"
    tnk.12.d: "Gonzalo's men, in a small boat, enter through the port of Madroza at the dusk of night. As the city sleeps, the armed men make their way to the center of the bustling capital. They eventually make their way through the long and intertwined streets of Madroza, into their location of interest; the Madroza National Bank. \n \n The men unload their weapons, their contacts get in place, and the assault begins. Like a blitz, every security guard and armed forces member who didn't know or wasn't in the plan orchestrated by Gonzalo, was taken down or knocked out unconscious. The men made their way into the vault of Madroza, put all its riches in their bags, and like true professionals, escaped without leaving a trace or even alerting the authorities. \n \n By the time the army of Ardante arrived at the scene, nothing was left. All was heisted, in one of if not the greatest bank heist ever executed in the history of the Eastern continent. The country is now in shock, and now with a massive gap in the national treasury, Ardante bleeds. Will Gonzalo pay for his crimes? Only time will tell."
    tnk.13.d: "We have received request from Gonzalo Delgado, current leader of the Herring & Martor Republic. He tells of a Social-Democratic Federation comprising all nations in Aecor. He asks for us to take his hand and join the Republic, as the first integrants of the new federation. If we are to accept, we gain statehood in something that may be bigger than even the legacy of this island or aecor. If we are to deny, we could take the opportunity and take the republic out in its weakest state."
    tnk.14.d: "At the recent conference in Buena Vista, we have received the option to join the newly-formed Aecorian Federation, and bear a new light to Aecor's legacy. If we are to accept, we will get statehood in the Federation, otherwise, we can simply decline and go on with our sovereignty. What shall we do?"
    tnk.15.d: "A mysterious pillager band has formed in the North. Part of a possible ominous expedition into the area, they seek to plunder and destroy the East. We have fought against ravagers and monsters, so this isn't all too unfamiliar to us. However, these guys might be much more than we actually think, and a much bigger threat. Regardless, we will take them down and restore order in this region."
    tnk.16.d: "Recently we've got an envoy from Ardante demanding our vassalization and integration into the Kingdom. If we are to refuse, we will face possible annihilation from the Ardantean Military. Otherwise, we could accept and become a puppet to their will, trully becoming part of the Ardatean Military branch, somewhat like what was once Crooked Hook. What shall we do?"   
    news.69.d_01: "We've received news from the Ardantean armed forces that they've entered a dimension lost to legend called 'The End'. Despite all the talk drumming it up to be folktale coming from Endermen, the legendary dimension was actually real, with the President of the Ardantean Republic holding an Endstone Block, a block only present in this dimension, in his recent speech.\n \n The armed forces of Ardante have also confirmed the existance of a legendary Dragon in the region, and a bustling population of native endermen. Whatever this implies for the overworld is scary to think about. Only time will tell what will happen to the Overworld after this. "
