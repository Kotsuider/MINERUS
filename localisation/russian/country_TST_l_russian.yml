  TST_stacey_west: "Стэйси Уьэст"
  TST_stacey_west_leader_desc: "Стэйси Уьэс is the leader of the Agricultural League of Truffleshroom Terra. She is known to be a staunch conservative and anti-socialist. Like most of the inhabitants of Truffleshroom Terra, Stacey grew up on a mooshroom ranch with a ranching family. She decided to go into politics at age 21 and has since become the favoured candidate in the elections. Embodying many of the values that the ranchers consider important has meant that miss West was able to expand her political career to greater heights. However, with a lack of a proper army and a population unwilling to change that fact, it remains to be seen just how well this rancher nation survives during dire times. Whatever happens, Stacey West has your back! (or so she claims)"
