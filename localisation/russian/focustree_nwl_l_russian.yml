NWL_arrest_the_villagists:0 "Arrest The Villagists"
NWL_arrest_the_villagists_desc:0 "Those populist traitors want to separate us from the rest of the kingdom. Clearly this amounts to treason and open rebellion. Mr George Moorson will have to pay for this betrayal."
NWL_establish_the_junta:0 "Establish The Junta"
NWL_establish_the_junta_desc:0 "In times of crisis, it is common for the Eastern Armed Forces to take control over areas. We will use the crisis laws of old to create a military junta that will rule until the Eastern government decrees otherwise. I am sure the rest of the kingdom will understand our situation."
NWL_thebanditsdownsouth:0 "The "Bandits" Down South"
NWL_thebanditsdownsouth_desc:0 "Blackwood's Bandits has long been portrayed in propaganda and newspapers as merely being "heretical bandits that pose no threat to Northwall". While this is partially true, there is a serious risk to having an actual Herobrine-ist remnant sitting right on our border. We must decide what is to be done about these heretics."
NWL_bleedthemdry:0 "Bleed Them Dry!"
NWL_bleedthemdry_desc:0 "We don't HAVE to do any incursions into their lands. If we can simply keep them at bay, then the Northwallian people will never have to know the true extent of what these bandits truly are."
NWL_wipethemout:0 "Wipe Them Out!"
NWL_wipethemout_desc:0 "It is time we destroy this tumor that has been sitting on our border. We will fund a large expedition with the goal of destroying these bandits once and for all. We'll have to make some difficult choices regarding funding, leadership and supplies. If this expedition fails then the people will demand answers."
NWL_banditsposenothreat:0 ""Bandits Pose No Threat""
NWL_banditsposenothreat_desc:0 "Our propaganda regarding the bandits to our south has never failed us. We can simply continue to boost the narrative that these are merely heretical bandits. These bandits cannot break through our fortline anyway, so we should be safe. Notch will protect us!"
NWL_anoldenemyhasbeendefeated:0 ""An Old Enemy Has Been Defeated""
NWL_anoldenemyhasbeendefeated_desc:0 "With the expedition's grand success, we can officially establish a military government in the newly conquered areas. This new government will have the task of clearing the land of heretical influences so that our people may settle on it. These Herobrine-ists will have to move if they don't wish to convert."
NWL_riotsinthecapital:0 ""Riots In The Capital""
NWL_riotsinthecapital_desc:0 "Our expedition was a huge failure and the people are mad. Many young men and women died against what everyone assumed were "defenseless bandits". With this defeat, it will be difficult to stage another expedition, meaning that we won't be able to defeat our old foe. A stinging wound, for sure."
NWL_northwallstillstands:0 "Northwall Still Stands!"
NWL_northwallstillstands_desc:0 "Despite our history and the brutal second unification war, Northwall still stands proud and tall. While the political situation is decently stable, there are some figures that are worth keeping an eye on."
NWL_the_reintegrationists:0 "The Re-Integrationists"
NWL_the_reintegrationists_desc:0 "The Re-Integrationists are a big concern of the current Northwallian government. They support the Eastern Kingdom and are pushing for diplomatic contact with our former overlord to be re-established. This comes as a threat to the sitting party, who is known to be a prominent ally of ardante."
NWL_the_independents:0 "The Independents"
NWL_the_independents_desc:0 "The Independents are a collection of various villagist parties who are all united behind the goal of wrestling Northwall away from the influence of foreign empires. The common people seem to love them, but abandoning ardante may come at too high of a price. If we are to stave off a popular revolt, then these villagist revolutionaries must be appeased."
NWL_the_labourers:0 "The Labourers"
NWL_the_labourers_desc:0 "The Agrarian-Socialist miners and farmers are not to be underestimated. They make up a sizeable portion of our workforce and stand firmly against the Northwallian nobility and landowners. They may not be much of a threat to the government, but the country's rich elite want them gone."
NWL_a_plan_of_action:0 "A Plan of Action"
NWL_a_plan_of_action_desc:0 "The Northwallian independence celebrations are coming up soon. This important once-in-a-year event always unites the country and bring people closer together. Different groups have proposed various plans for this year's celebrations. We'll have to decide which one we pick. No doubt whichever plan gets chosen will give the groups backing it a huge boost. That is potentially something that we could take advantage of."
NWL_paradesinthecountryside:0 "Parades In The Countryside!"
NWL_paradesinthecountryside_desc:0 "The independence festival is being held in the rural parts of the country. Bringing people to the lesser known areas will be a huge help to the farmers and miners, but may come at a cost for the ruling party."
NWL_showtheworldourmight:0 "Show The World Our Might!"
NWL_showtheworldourmight_desc:0 "The military has proposed a plan to hold grand military parades all over the country's major cities. While this is pretty much just a display of force to the rest of the world, it could make our former Eastern overlords much more aware of our existence. Though, the Re-Integrationists will greatly benefit from more international attention."
NWL_organizefestivitiesforthepeople:0 "Organize Festivities For The People!"
NWL_organizefestivitiesforthepeople_desc:0 "A plan was proposed by popular villagist speaker George Moorson. He plans to organize plenty of festivities including music events, lavish parties, all-you-can-eat buffets as well as many speeches by famous celebrities. While this would be great for increasing the trust of the people in the government, it would also benefit mr Moorson himself in a big way. If he can do an official government speech to the masses, then he can bring his views to a far-reaching audience. Should we give him a voice?"
NWL_a_grand_feast_for_the_elite:0 "A Grand Feast For The Elite"
NWL_a_grand_feast_for_the_elite_desc:0 "The local elite have proposed a different plan compared to all the other ones. They suggest holding a feast at the governmental palace. This would be paid for using the money meant for the independence celebrations. While this would increase the ruling party's power over those with true influence in our country, it may turn every other group against us. Do we risk our reputation for political gain?"
NWL_from_celebrations_to_protests:0 "From Celebrations To Protests"
NWL_from_celebrations_to_protests_desc:0 "Our countryside parades have given the socialists an unprecedented amount of influence in the country. Seeing an opportunity, they have ordered strikes and protests across the nation to bring even more attention to the problems of the rural provinces. We must decide on a plan of action before it is too late."
NWL_the_military_coup:0 "The Military Coup"
NWL_the_military_coup_desc:0 "Our own military has stabbed us in the back! Through the various military parades, they have seized control of our major cities and threaten our hold on power. Perhaps we could ask some of our political enemies for help?"
NWL_the_speech_for_liberation:0 "The Speech For Liberation"
NWL_the_speech_for_liberation_desc:0 "In the grand speech that George Moorson gave from the balcony of the governmental palace, he called for elections, more freedom and demanded that Ian Kladair step down from power. People have gotten riled up because of this and something must be done. Time is of the essence!"
NWL_the_independent_republic_of_northwall:0 "The Independent Republic of Northwall"
NWL_the_independent_republic_of_northwall_desc:0 "Northwall is free, indepedent and united. Through great strife we have accomplished our goals and brought our ideals to our home. As we look at our progress, most of us are amazed that many years ago we could not have hoped for such an outcome. United and free, Northwall stands."
NWL_the_anger_of_the_masses:0 "The Anger of The Masses"
NWL_the_anger_of_the_masses_desc:0 "The common people are outraged by the lavish display of wealth shown at the grand party. They are shocked that the government would fund the elite instead of the people. George Moorson has called for riots, the military watches with a keen eye and the socialists are striking. We cannot call upon anyone for favours, apart from our friendly neighbours. We must pray to Notch that the ardantians can help us out."
NWL_theworkersvictorious:0 "The Workers Victorious!"
NWL_theworkersvictorious_desc:0 "Through revolution and unity, the working class has prevailed. We have triumphed over the elitists and have taken back the land that used to be ours. Now we must form a new government. One that will last into the future."
NWL_the_military_in_charge:0 "The Military in Charge"
NWL_the_military_in_charge_desc:0 "Through cunning strategies and overwhelming force, we came out on top. Northwall was never meant to be independent, it belongs to the Eastern Kingdom. Army Group North held out against the dark armies. It is about time we gave our king an update on the status of the frontline."
NWL_thepeoplehavetriumphed:0 "The People Have Triumphed!"
NWL_thepeoplehavetriumphed_desc:0 "We did it! The oligarchic regime has been overthrown and the people now finally rule Northwall. We will organize our elections and say goodbye to all the various empires that tried to dominate us. Northwall stands alone, proud and free!"
NWL_for_those_with_wealth_and_power:0 "For Those With Wealth and Power"
NWL_for_those_with_wealth_and_power_desc:0 "The elite, the landlords and the nobility are the ones who keep our society running. Their leadership makes sure that the common folk can go about their lives not having to worry about the finer art of politics. With the help of our friends up north as well as some political wrangling, we have come out on top once more. The status quo will be upheld."
NWL_repeal_the_landownership_laws:0 "Repeal The Landownership laws"
NWL_repeal_the_landownership_laws_desc:0 "The landowners and the nobility were only able to become so powerful by exploiting the laws that were in place. The communes have proposed repealing all of the exploitable landownership laws that made this oppression possible. This would also make it impossible to buy or sell land, which means the farmers and miners will get back the territory they worked so hard to gain."
NWL_the_fate_of_sir_ian_kladair:0 "The Fate of Sir Ian Kladair"
NWL_the_fate_of_sir_ian_kladair_desc:0 "Ian Kladair, the former leader of the Northwallian government, was arrested on charges of treason and disloyalty. While it cannot be proven that he actually committed those crimes, we can falsify the record so that we can lock him up for good. We can also set him free, which may show the world that Northwallian socialism is not only peaceful, but very merciful as well."
NWL_hold_elections:0 "Hold Elections"
NWL_hold_elections_desc:0 "The villagists fought for the people in the same way as we did. Holding elections would not just reward them for their actions but it would also help with legitimising our control over Northwall. Of course, we would have to actually win such an election, but that is a small risk to take when compared to the many people that risked their lives fighting tyranny."
NWL_sideline_the_villagists:0 "Sideline The Villagists"
NWL_sideline_the_villagists_desc:0 "The villagists did nothing to help us with our victory. While they screamed about elections and freedom, we took action to limit the authority of the upper class. They don't deserve their elections, for the only true way for the people to rule is via socialism. Mr Moorson will never accept such a harsh stance, but he doesn't need to. I heard that the west has plenty of villages for him to live the true "villagist lifestyle"."
NWL_thepeoplesrepublicofnorthwall:0 "The Agricultural Union of Northwall"
NWL_thepeoplesrepublicofnorthwall_desc:0 "With the majority of our reforms done, the country is in a much better place. Free from tyranny and elitism, Northwall will march into a new age. One where the workers do not have to fear eviction, for the land they work on is finally theirs."
NWL_the_grand_election:0 "The Grand Election"
NWL_the_grand_election_desc:0 "With the power now in the hands of the villagist coalition, it is about time that the people get a say in who holds the power. Should this election go smoothly, then it will prove that Northwall can be truly free and that the people have a rightful mandate to power."
NWL_foreignpuppetsnomore:0 "Foreign Puppets No More!"
NWL_foreignpuppetsnomore_desc:0 "With the villagist victory, ardantian forces have left our country as they saw the writing on the wall. Now that the country stands on the brink of greatness, it is about time that we announce our intentions to the world."
NWL_our_political_rivals:0 "Our Political Rivals"
NWL_our_political_rivals_desc:0 "Our rivals have done plenty to try and win influence for themselves. Just because they lost does not mean that they cannot try again. With the elections being prepared, we will pardon all political opponents of the villagist coalition. A true villagist paradise does not bar anyone from running in the election."
NWL_isolationism_and_peace:0 "Isolationism and Peace"
NWL_isolationism_and_peace_desc:0 "Now that the country has been saved, we must not involve ourselves with other overworld affairs. Declaring our full neutrality would give Northwall the rest it needs to rebuild itself after this troublesome time."
NWL_exportfreedomabroad:0 "Export Freedom Abroad!"
NWL_exportfreedomabroad_desc:0 "Why should we sit here and watch as the villagist dream gets snuffed out in other nations? Don't all people deserve to be truly free and prosperous? Our army is still standing and ready. Let's topple some tyrants, shall we?"
NWL_your_land_for_your_loyalty:0 "Your Land For Your Loyalty"
NWL_your_land_for_your_loyalty_desc:0 "The socialists do not pose much a threat. They were simply victims of a regime that sold us out to a foreign power. In return for them receiving the land they so wish, we will demand that they support our efforts to unite with the rest of the kingdom. I am sure they will be willing to make that trade."
NWL_send_christopher_gravedigger_south:0 "Send Christopher Gravedigger South"
NWL_send_christopher_gravedigger_south_desc:0 "There is only one individual that can possibly deliver the good news to the Eastern Kingdom. Commander Gravedigger himself will go to Krinios to bring the government the happy news."
NWL_send_a_military_envoy:0 "Send A Military Envoy"
NWL_send_a_military_envoy_desc:0 "Sending simply one man is a disgrace to the might of the Eastern Kingdom. We must send an entire army group to parade through Krinios upon our return. I am sure the citizens of the city would be excited to hear our grand tales."
NWL_army_group_north:0 "Army Group North"
NWL_army_group_north_desc:0 "We finally did it. Contact has been re-established with the rest of the kingdom. We are once more serving the true government of the East and we have secured the north. With this grand reunion must come a celebration. We will invite the kingdom's leaders for a feast. A party to celebrate two long lost brothers meeting once more!"
NWL_reform_the_army:0 "Reform The Army"
NWL_reform_the_army_desc:0 "Considering just how lucky we are to still be in power, we must ensure that our most important tool stays sharp. The army must be loyal to the government above all else, so all disloyal elements must be rounded up. No rebels must remain."
NWL_backtoworksocialists:0 "Back To Work, Socialists!"
NWL_backtoworksocialists_desc:0 "There is only one proper way to deal with socialism, brute force. We will break up the strikes with violence and anyone who does not go back to work will feel the consequences. This could have been settled peacefully, but like everything socialist, it can only be done the hard way."
NWL_the_state_of_northwall:0 "The State of Northwall"
NWL_the_state_of_northwall_desc:0 "Northwall has always been the country of the rich. This will not change just because some rioters and good-for-nothing heroes pretend otherwise. With our power secured, Northwall is safe. We do not ask for your loyalty, merely for your tolerance. Is that too difficult to give?"
NWL_iankladairsrightfulmandate:0 "Ian Kladair's rightful mandate"
NWL_iankladairsrightfulmandate_desc:0 "Sir Ian Kladair has faithfully served this nation for many years now. He has seen us through a major crisis and showed his competence once more. Is there even a better man for the job? Some believe not. Perhaps it would be best if mr Kladair served Northwall even longer. Perhaps for the rest of his long and no doubt prosperous life."
NWL_the_rule_of_the_elite:0 "The Rule of The Elite"
NWL_the_rule_of_the_elite_desc:0 "Mr Kladair has served his purpose. He is no longer of any use to us and thus may leave his career in politics. He will be replaced by those who hold the true power within Northwall: the rich and influential."
NWL_the_army_compromise:0 "The Army Compromise"
NWL_the_army_compromise_desc:0 "The army stayed loyal to their country and sided with us during the turmoil. While this is commendable, the Re-Integrationists still wish to contact the Eastern Kingdom. We can send Christopher Gravedigger on a very special journey to the Krinios as a diplomat. While this is far from what the army wanted, it is something at the very least."
NWL_the_tragic_death_of_george_moorson:0 "The Tragic Death of George Moorson"
NWL_the_tragic_death_of_george_moorson_desc:0 "Mr Moorson was a beloved figure in Northwallian politics. He fought for what he believed in and died for it. Of course, the newspapers claim it was an accidental fall from a cliff. We know better, but he will still get a state-funded funeral, even if it is only to satisfy the remaining villagists."
NWL_create_the_golem_corps:0 "Create The Golem Corps"
NWL_create_the_golem_corps_desc:0 "Golems have been used by villagers for many years to defend their lands. We could use these golems in our army, which would give us an edge over our opponents."
NWL_national_recruitment_drive:0 "National Recruitment Drive"
NWL_national_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "We need more men and women in the army if we are to improve it. A recruitment drive would help in attracting the soldiers of tomorrow."
NWL_mobilize_militia_units:0 "Mobilize Militia Units"
NWL_mobilize_militia_units_desc:0 "While our professional force is already good, a militia would allow us to deploy lesser trained units in a quicker fashion. These irregulars can support our main army and would be easy to call up in times of war."
NWL_harsher_training_methods:0 "Harsher Training Methods"
NWL_harsher_training_methods_desc:0 "Our current training methods are believed to be insufficient. With harsher training, our army would produce higher quality soldiers at the cost of available recruits."
NWL_a_full_army_of_golems:0 "A Full Army of Golems"
NWL_a_full_army_of_golems_desc:0 "Golems are an effective unit to deploy on any battlefield. If we expand our logistics, then we can maintain more of them at the cost of our regular infantry soldiers."
NWL_building_a_navy:0 "Building A Navy"
NWL_building_a_navy_desc:0 "While we don't currently have any naval vessels, some of our army officers have suggested building some to allow us to protect our own waters. This would stimulate trade while also showing to the world that Northwall doesn't need anyone else to keep Northwallian merchants from being raided by pirates."
NWL_expanding_the_farms:0 "Expanding The Farms"
NWL_expanding_the_farms_desc:0 "Food is the lifeblood of all nations. Without out, many would starve to death. Investing more into food is always good."
NWL_the_industry_bill:0 "The Industry Bill"
NWL_the_industry_bill_desc:0 "With these new changes, a final 'industry bill' will be drafted to officially finalize our improvement efforts. Now, Northwall can march into the future a little more safely."
NWL_the_northwallian_armed_forces:0 "The Northwallian Armed Forces"
NWL_the_northwallian_armed_forces_desc:0 "Our army is in a good state, but could always be better. Currently, our army is modelled to be a defensive force, meaning that any offensives will be difficult to do. With some improvements, the NAF could be repurposed to once again go on the offensive rather than purely defend our current territory."
NWL_strengthen_the_fortline:0 "Strengthen The Fortline"
NWL_strengthen_the_fortline_desc:0 "Our famous fortline has held for many years, but its age is starting to show. The Army wants us to build some new forts along the border to increase our defensive capabilities. We would be happy to put more funding towards this project."
NWL_secure_the_mountain_paths:0 "Secure The Mountain Paths"
NWL_secure_the_mountain_paths_desc:0 "The people that live in the mountainous regions of our country are complaining about bandits blocking the roads. Removing these criminals from the region would earn us some support, while also allowing us to do some much needed upgrades to the infrastructure of the region."
NWL_the_industrial_problem:0 "The Industrial Problem"
NWL_the_industrial_problem_desc:0 "Our workshops have been quite neglected as of late. It is about time that we put some more funding towards our industry."
NWL_a_people_focused_industry:0 "A People Focused Industry"

NWL_a_military_focused_industry:0 "A Military Focused Industry"
NWL_a_military_focused_industry_desc:0 "The army is the backbone of our society and protects Northwall from threats both within and outside of it. Their needs should be seen to first."
