###Events###
enc.1.d: "From a humble group of barons coming from Cerulea escaping theft, to a small kingdom, to a group of warring clans, proceeded by an unshatterable Shogunate and into a true Empire. Our rich historical inheritance gives us the merit as an unkillable nation at heart. The Empire of the Enchanted Lands has grown such a cultural and historical identity that it is impervious to elimination and destruction. Our history is massive and our cultural is sprawling with histories and tales. The Folklore creatures; the battles we waged; the unity we created; the surge in modernization of the past century that frightened every single nation. We are immortal! \n\nWith cities bustling with players of all kinds, with beautiful scenaries that strike envy in all the overworld's nations and a glorious pride, our nation stands tall in the renegated region of the Deep South being a powerful emerging state aiming its eyes on the world stage. \n\nWith the greater south at a looming war, and with the world's old hegemonies collapsing, it is time for we to shine! Despite being highly discriminated upon by the southeners and the imperians, having their legation trade cities encrusted into our backs, we may not submit to the old hegemonies. Our faith is in our hands and our hands only. BANZAI!"
enc.2.d: "As of now however, we stand in a crossroad for the future of our nation and the Enchanted Lands. Our politics is shattered in 3 main groups: The Vanguardists, The Sakamoto Royalists and The Democratic Front. Each exercise a level of control in certain areas of our politics. They alone decide the faith of our people! \n\nThe Vanguardists are a group formed after the Sakamoto coup of 621. The Adherents of this group follow Sara Mountbatten, the direct descendant of Suhiro Daino, the man who modernized and westernized the Enchanted Lands. The followers of this movement represent a great portion of the population and could be a future danger. They are led by Sara Mountbatten. Opposite to that group stands the Sakamoto Royalists, all the players who plead alliegance to the current leader Takaniro Sakamoto. They represent half of the population but are on the threat of being overtaken by the other groups. And at last, a group who hates both sides and wishes for a reform in the Enchanted Lands' rule: The Democratic Social Reformist Front. The Democratic Social Reformist Front represents a small portion of the population. They're a violent group who fights for the democracy of the Enchanted Lands. They commmit to violent protests and terrorist attacks that gather nation-wide attention and attract major government persecution. Despite being minor and simply a loud group, if not contained the rise of democratic guerrilas and cells may be a headache for the nation, and in a worst case scenario, perhaps even a new major enemy of the state. \n\n In the following weeks a speech will be held by Takaniro in Senkyo to try and weaken the other political parties. With such a political and controversial speech, security will be tight, but there have been several death threats from the other movements towards Takaniro. The future is blind."
enc.3.d: "A cold morning in Senkyo dawns. As the busy city is started up for the speech, Takaniro readies himself. After a time, hundreds of players show up at the gates of the Imperial palace. Those hundreds become thousands, and then tens of thousands, and in an instant, the crowd extends to hundreds of thousands; as far as the eye can see, the outside gates and the streets are filled with players. Patiently awaiting for the moment Takaniro speaks out about the political concerns of the nation. \n\nAs the curtains of the door to the balcony of are opened by Takaniro, the crowd turns into an array of mixed reactions, displaying their worry about the current state of the nation and politics. Takaniro starts his speech, pointing out the clear enemies of the state and whom is passive of persecution and targeting by the government. The Rebel Democratic Forces. The Vanguardists. Even minor groups such as the ASP and the Monster Guerrilas hiding out in the outskirts of shieldwall and in the thick woods of Midonami. As Takaniro continues his speech, the opposition groups amongst the crowds start to rattle their teeth in anger. \n\nThe crowd is fevered with hysteric yells and complaints. As the situation worsens, Takaniro continues his speech in the balcony. Unchallenged. Determined to point out the future of the Enchanted Lands as he invisions it. However, something happens. As the Emperor continues his rant over the poltical situation of the Enchanted Lands, something unexpected happens, the security of the speech is somehow breached by the opposition and..."
enc.40.d: "During Takaniro's speech, Sara Mountbatten and her armed followers were able to breach the security of the speech, arresting Takaniro and setting the crowd into a panic. Sara took the microphone and in fiery voice announced that the dynasty leading the nation will be dissoluted and the 'true' order will prevail, making an obvious homage to the Mountbatten rule. With the former Emperor being forcefully arrested and the grandious speech from Sara, a widespread inner conflict in the army began, with troops deserting to the Vanguard and taking over military HQ's; refusing to follow the orders of certain generals. The Naval Southern Assault Force has too revolted and refuses to take orders from Admiral Sengoku. The Regencial Council of the Enchanted Lands has taken over as a governmental figure. Sara is as of now mobilizing a column to take over the governmental seat of the Enchanted Lands. What will be our nation?"
enc.4.d: "After 2 weeks of built up and negotiation between Sara and the Regent council, talks break down and the Vanguardist column charges straight into Senkyo. From the Vanguardist side very light resistance was encountered, with small skirmishes between police officers and Vanguardist rebels; the army and police force are shattered. Sara has taken the throne and announced herself as the Empress of the Enchanted Lands. Humors exist of which detail Takaniro has been executed under the custody of the Vanguard. Now with Sara as the head of our nation, will the situation normalize or will we plunge into chaos?"
enc.5.d: "This sunday, the Empire was brought to terror. The Vanguardist party has rounded up and executed several hundreds of democratic protestors in a show of force. This has caused widespread outrage from the Democratic Front and enraged Villagist nations in the overworld. Attacks from the Guerrillas have intensified, but their influence has fallen over the regions they exercise their said influence. The Democratic Front Leader has promised to destroy Sara's regime."
enc.6.d: "Today, a small story about the unification of the Enchanted Lands during the sengoku was released. It is a very sentimental piece about the Sengoku and its unification. It gives out a message of unity and national pride, the story follows the story of the Sengoku and explores it thoroughly. It is a great small novel and is even praised by foreigners, despite being a clear propaganda piece. The cultural ramifications of this production may be massive."
enc.7.d: "The sun grazes the grove. So deep in the woods of Coral Plains, stands over 32 Guerrilla leaders. Huddled in fear, the Royal Guard stares them down. As quick as the eye can blink, a bloodshed starts. Player after player is killed. The day ends with a puddle of blood in the ground. The soldiers leave the grove, euphorically happy that they're 'saving' their nation \n \n In the rest of the nation, the now weakened Guerilla Cells are mercilesly raided by all branches of the Enchanted Army, ordered by Sara herself. As the death rolls throughout the day, the Democratic Front loses its last grips on our society. Sara has won, and the nation, saved."
enc.8.d: "Senkyo holds its breath. The trial starts and everyone is on the edge of their seats. For hours and hours, hundreds of manifestants, dozens of Guerrilla leaders, hundreds of Sympathizing Guerrilla officers, and the Leader of the Democratic Front himself, are trialed. Many executions, prison sentences and forced labour sentences were handed out. \n \n The key occurance of this event was the execution of the leader of the Democratic Front: Haraiashi Naoia. Haraiashi was sentenced to execution for several crimes against the Enchanted Lands. He was publicly executed 1 hour after the trial ended. This show of force by Sara solidifies her majesty as the supreme ruler of the Enchanted Lands. The Democratic Front has collapsed, and the Vanguardists risen. The Enchanted Lands will rise."
enc.9.d: "Last night our forces have raided Forestina Through the Guretupasu Bridge. Forestina was completely looted and their riches stolen. The Southern Player Empire is extremely mad at the raid and proclaimed that there will be consequences of said raiding. The Enchanted Lands has shown the world their worth. No more we will be bound to the imperial forces of the foreigners. TENKO HENKA BANZAI!"
enc.10.d: "Yesterday was made a proclamation by Sara. Her majesty declared the rid of western imperialism from the island and the rise of a new beggining for the Enchanted Lands. From now on, we will spread out and dominate the Deep South and the Southwest. With the situation in the south worsening, the Southern Player Empire and Imperia has ill any force to fight a war with the Enchante Lands, instead diverting their focus elsewhere. We will rise and dominate the Deep south."
enc.11.d: "Yesterday was reported the fall of Tilcara. The City collapsed under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It has now been renamed to 'Hoen' as in reference of the village that stood there before the occupation by the westerners"
enc.12.d: "Yesterday was reported the attack of Tilcara. The City held out even under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It is an humiliating defeat for the Enchanted Lands and her majesty Sara."
enc.13.d: "Yesterday was reported the attack of Tilcara. The City held out even under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It is an humiliating defeat for the Enchanted Lands and her majesty Sara."
enc.14.d: "Yesterday was reported the fall of Tilcara. The City collapsed under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It has now been renamed to 'Hoen' as in reference of the village that stood there before the occupation by the westerners"
enc.15.d: "Yesterday was reported the fall of Lendorff. The City collapsed under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It has now been renamed to 'Katamoni' as in reference of the village that stood there before the occupation by the westerners"
enc.16.d: "Yesterday was reported the attack of Lendorff. The City held out even under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It is an humiliating defeat for the Enchanted Lands and her majesty Sara."
enc.17.d: "Yesterday was reported the attack of Lendorff. The City held out even under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It is an humiliating defeat for the Enchanted Lands and her majesty Sara."
enc.18.d: "Yesterday was reported the fall of Lendorff. The City collapsed under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It has now been renamed to 'Katamoni' as in reference of the village that stood there before the occupation by the westerners"
enc.19.d: "Yesterday was reported the fall of New Hayla. The City collapsed under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It has now been renamed to 'Joltoh' as in reference of the village that stood there before the occupation by the westerners"
enc.20.d: "Yesterday was reported the attack of New Hayla. The City held out even under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It is an humiliating defeat for the Enchanted Lands and her majesty Sara."
enc.21.d: "Yesterday was reported the attack of New Hayla. The City held out even under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It is an humiliating defeat for the Enchanted Lands and her majesty Sara."
enc.22.d: "Yesterday was reported the fall of New Hayla. The City collapsed under the weight of the Enchanted attack. It has now been renamed to 'Joltoh' as in reference of the village that stood there before the occupation by the westerners"
enc.23.d: "This is a matter of revenge. We have failed our invasion of Haven centuries ago, and we wont fail now. We will do everything in our power to destroy the government of Haven and bring havoc to their island. Our nation will not falter and we will be able to bring her to greatness. DOWN WITH THE CELESTIAL STATE!"
enc.24.d: "Yesterday the Legation Cities of Haven have been taken. The end of the parasites known as 'Legation Cities' is true! Now that we rid our nation of them, we can further expand our reach! The Deep South is for Deep Southerners only."
enc.25.d: "We have done it. We have raised our flags on the demonic Ominous Legion. We have finally won. The Enchanted Lands is the new hegemony of the Deep South. We will take over and spread our reach to the overworld! Our divine faith is here, our empress is sacred, our home is sacred, all our united faiths are divine. \n \n We were and always are destined to greatness. The Enchanted lands will prosper even if it faces further troubles and struggle. We are indomitable. TENKO. HENKA. BANZAI!!!"
enc.26.d: "During his majesty's speech, two armed constitutionalist rebels infiltrate the balcony and pull their swords out. Takaniro is stabbed to death. The crowd goes crazy. The shouts and yells of panic and rage are heard throughout the borough, players trample on themselves as they try to get away from the Palace. The Emperor's lifeless body is thrown into the porch out from the balcony, the players nearby throw up in sheer shock. \n \n The security staff makes haste and put down the two armed players after the deeds. This brutal and 'clean' assassination of the Emperor^ is doomed to cause unforeseen consequences in the political stage. The Regent Council is desperately trying to sort things out and there are rumors of democratic guerrillas spurting in the Coral Forest and the several hamlets deep within the woods of Midonami. Our country is quite literally doomed to fall apart once again. The Democratic Leader is presumably organizing a militia to take on the Enchanted Army. Cases of violent assault and battery are being reported nation-wide and its suspects have ties with the Democratic Front. This single political organization is a threat to our nation. We are bound to the chaos and panic they're leaving in their wake of chaos and degeneracy."
enc.27.d: "Operation Katana is abstract in its nature. With the government and its army spread out to hunt out our guerrilla cells, we can properly utilize of unorthodox fighting forces. We will go to the mountains, the treetops and the sewers. We will fight everywhere and always and anytime. With time we will soon perfect this practice and tactics. We intend to use this in the civil war. "
enc.28.d: "The civil war has been won! We have finally triumphed over the wretched monarchists and taken the seat of power of the Enchanted Lands. With us getting such a triumphant victory over the monarchist scum, we can finally rally up our leaders and start the First General Elections! The elections will involve both the selection of our leadership and type of government. As of right now we have been divided amongst two sides: The Conservatists and the Radicals. \n \n The Radicals preach for ideas of a republic, adhering to a complete destruction of the Monarchist system of our nation. Should we follow with their ideals, our nation is to become a Federal Republic. \n \n In the other hand, we have the conservatists. They want to mantain the Monarchy and the Traditional Society of the Enchanted Lands. With this we will form a Parliamentary Monarchy, with Sara Mountbatten, as its figurehead. Despite her nationalist tendencies, shes as of now under a tight grip of the Democratic Government, as her Vanguardist Party is on the verge of collapse. \n \n Regardless of our picking. We will have democracy and it to spread to the overworld. Shortly after the selection of our form of government, the elections for PM or President will begin. This will ensure our leadership through democratic and fair means. Glory to the New beggining! Tenko Henka Banzai! "
enc.29.d: "As of recently, the Enchanted Lands has demanded Hon-Kao away from our holding, with the justification that Haven doesn't exist as a proper state anymore and that the Legation Cities shouldnt affect a nation for who has nothing to do with the Western Trade Towns. What shall we do? Can we really afford a war with the Empire of the Enchanted Lands?"
enc.30.d: "As of recently, the Enchanted Lands has demanded the legation cities away from our nation, with the justification that Haven doesn't exist as a proper state anymore and that the Legation Cities shouldnt affect a nation for who has nothing to do with the Western Trade Towns. What shall we do? Can we really afford a war with the Empire of the Enchanted Lands?"
enc.31.d: "Yesterday was received a letter of invitation to the Newly Formed United Kingdom of the Enchanted Lands. The letter demands our invitation to the greater United Kingdom, serving as one of the districts of the nation. Should we give in our sovereignty to server wider democracy or should we fight and fend for ourselves? If we refuse we are certain that the Enchanted Lands Empire will invade us."
enc.32.d: "Our nation has grown alot since the turmoil of the late 40's. We have freed our people from tyranny and claimed a spot int he Overworld for ourselves. Our great nation stands tall over everything else, with its principles of democracy and value, we are the sole survivors of this ever-so growing damned overworld. If we are able to save ourselves from chaos, we surely are able to save the others from it. Our nation will not fail in our struggle for world-wide freedom. Glory to the United Kingdom! TENKO HENKA BANZAI!"
enc.33.d: "Recently the Enchanted Lands has invited us to their new faction, the SOTDO. The SOTDO aims to spread democracy throughout the world, and we could benefit from this. However, this could very well damage our sovereignty down the line. Should we give up our own will for a foreign country?"
enc.34.d: "As of recent, the Celestial Palace received an awkward request. The Enchanted Lands has invited us to their new faction! The SOTDO. It aims to spread democracy to the whole world. This is a very strange request from a former foe, but we should consider this as if we unite we could perhaps forge a beter Deep South. But, we still gotta remember that they completely ravaged us centuries ago and are a culprit for our current suffering. This is a matter to not be taken lightly."
enc.35.d: "Haven has denied our offer of joining the SOTDO. This is a clear transgression to democracy and is being portrayed as such by the senate. People are calling for war and are outraged over this matter. The single chance we get them to make peace with us and become allies in arms, we are spit on! Will our nation endure this? Will our nation not intervene in this clear transgression?"
enc.36.d: "As of recently, the Enchanted Lands has demanded our eastern legation cities away from our holding, with the justification that the former government doesn't exist and that the Legation Cities are now useless. What shall we do? Can we really afford a war with the Empire of the Enchanted Lands?"
enc.37.d: "As of recently, the Enchanted Lands has demanded our eastern legation cities away from our holding, with the justification that the former government doesn't exist and that the Legation Cities are now useless. What shall we do? Can we really afford a war with the Empire of the Enchanted Lands?"
enc.38.d: "With the dawn of the new Enchanted Lands Federation, all the members of the SOTDO have received invites! Should we join the Federation and become one with the Enchanted Lands? Or should we simply follow as her ally? Whatever the choice, we can perhaps bringe the world to a better place."
enc.39.d: "The Enchanted Lands has come a long way. We have from the damp swamps of Qara and the groves of Midonami razed the existance of the former tyrannical governmentand destroyed their system of dictatorship and autocracy. We have fought for democracy ever since the start of the DSRF. We will now show our manifestation of democracy by formalizing a true Federation, encompassing all of the Deep South and more. This is a historical feat for our nation and we will never fall to dictatorships or tyranny ever again! TENKO HENKA BANZAI!"
enc.41.d: "During Takaniro's speech an arrow darted above the crowd and hit the balcony where Takaniro was hosting the speech. This clear act of terrorism and political violence set the crowd ablaze, with waves of people fleeing from the area. During the evacuation, the suspect tripped and accidentally let his bow fall into the ground, alerting the crowd and provoking a lynching by the fleeing civilians. The security was quick to spot the culprit, and he was promptly arrested and identified as a Democratic Rebel. \n \n Takaniro, a few hours after the speech has declared nartial law and is currently ramping up security in the perimeters of Senkyo and the boroughs near the palace. He also declared that there will be severe consequences to the other parties and in specific the DSRF. \n \n This public assassination attempt, which was feared and unfortunately witnessed by many, may set our nation into further politic Havoc. With Sara ramping up her fiery nationalistic speeches and blaming the westerners for this act; the DSRF commiting to more terrorist acts and the minor groups creating more Guerrillas in the woods of Midonami and Peaks of Shieldwall; the political divide our nation has suffered with for so many years is about to set into a new course. We will surely face a massive repression from his Majesty towards the other political parties. With Jeb may our nation be. We will need his blessings for the upcoming future.  "
enc.42.d: "After the unfortunate situation during Takaniro's speech, his Majesty has proceeded to partake in a Royal Marriage with princess Yua of the Sakazuki family. The marriage happened in the Royal Church of Jeb in Senkyo, with hundreds of royalty and celebrities showing up. The marriage was announced and broadcasted by Radio nation-wide. The prospects of a heir have massively calmed the civilian population, who feared that if Sakamoto was to perish, the Empire would not longer have a heir. The marriage was successful and no security breaches happened like in the speech. This marriage has striked a fit of rage in the opposing groups to the Sakamoto Family. But anyways, despite of all, lets all raise a drink to the new couple! Banzai!"
enc.43.d: "We have finally calmed down the situations in the Empire. We can finally dive deep into Overworld politics at last! Our years of isolation, struggles followed by divide and unification are long over! Our nation shall prosper and we will conquer a spot in World politics, reaching our hand out around the world! We will be a Great and united Nation, forever and ever. This is the Empire of the Enchanted lands! TENKO HENKA BANZAI!!!"
enc.44.d: "Recently, the Enchanted Lands has reached out to us in a request of joining the SPP. Should we accept them and we would have a powerful ally in the south. But should we deny them and mantain our integrity, not accepting a newbie Empire in the world politics. This however could cause them to have a revanchist sentiment towards us. What choice do we make?"
enc.45.d: "In prospect of our ever-growing friendship with the Empire of the Enchanted Lands, we have been invited into the SPP by them. Should we join them and become allies of the SPE and true allies of the EL. Or in retrospect, become fully independent with no worriers of attacks from foreign powers."
enc.46.d: "The Enchanted Lands has been able to get Haven to join our Alliance. This is a historical moment as we have united the Deep South under the SPP, meeting our true goal. May the SPP prosper!"
enc.47.d: "The Enchanted Lands has stormed and seize Lendorff. Our forces have failed to contain the waves of Enchanted Soldiers, we have lost our only holding in their island! The SPP is progressively expanding, and this is awful for our plans in the region. What will be of us in the future?"
enc.48.d: "Our friendship with the Southern Player Empire is massive! We can do so much together if both our nations are to unite! We will send them a proposal of unification to their government, claming an unification of both our crowns. This will be very beneficial to both of us. Now we just need to make a decision on who will lead the nation as the king, the Leader of the Southern players or our majesty. Regardless, we will prosper in the overworld through this royal union."
enc.49.d: "The Enchanted lands has reached out to us asking for the unification of both our Nations. This will be a massive feat in the history of our world and we will have a major new world order. Should we accept and we will unify under the banner of our leadership. This could be problematic as the Sakamoto have already stablished order in their region. But this means our leader will be the king."
enc.50.d: "The Enchanted lands has reached out to us asking for the unification of both our Nations. This will be a massive feat in the history of our world and we will have a major new world order. Should we accept and we will unify under the banner of the Sakamoto crown. This could be valuable as the Sakamoto have already stablished order in their region. But this means our leader will be a vice-king."
enc.51.d: "The Southern Player Empire, despite of our wish of unifying under their banner, has decided to unify under ours. It is pretty out of place on why they'd do such decision, but I suppose all we can do is accept it."
enc.52.d: "We have invaded and seized the Legation Cities. The Overworld empires are outraged at this clear act of agression, however, they cannot do much as they're way too distant from our nation. We shall cherish this invasion forever! It is a time of celebration, as we have finally stablish full control over our island. No Empire will mantain us as slaves!"
enc.53.d: "Our nation is now supreme. The Empire of the Enchanted Lands has gone through it all. The Rise and Fall; the political divide; the pain; the drama. Our little romance is more beautiful than any other nation could ever think off. Our history is the greatest in the overworld and we should be proud for her. Our great nation will withstand all that the world throws at us, and now that we have unified the Deep South under one colonial flag, we can finally prosper and reach heights never once imagined. We will always be free and we will never be slaves to any other nation! TENKO. HENKA. BANZAI!!!!!!!"

 ENC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "TENKO HENKA BANZAI!!! Having its first iteration created in 132 as the Kingdom of the Enchanted Lands, our Empire has grown both culturally and historically throughout the years, becoming an emerging power in the South-West and for that matter the Deep South. After the 621 Coup by the Sakamoto family, a rich crest with ins on the old government the nation has shattered in political mayhem, with three distinct rival political groups emerging. With such broken unity in the nation and a looming war in the South, what will be of our nation? "
 ###News###
 enc.news.2.t: "The Bloody Sunday."
 enc.news.2.desc: "This sunday, the Empire was brought to terror. The Vanguardist party has rounded up and executed several hundreds of democratic protestors in a show of force. This has caused widespread outrage from the Democratic Front and enraged Villagist nations in the overworld. Attacks from the Guerrillas have intensified, but their influence has fallen over the regions they exercise their said influence. The Democratic Front Leader has promised to destroy Sara's regime."
 enc.news.2.a: "Anything to tackle the constitutionalist threat must be enforced."
 enc.news.3.t: "Legacy of an Unifier"
 enc.news.3.desc: "Today, a small story about the unification of the Enchanted Lands during the sengoku was released. It is a very sentimental piece about the Sengoku and its unification. It gives out a message of unity and national pride, the story follows the story of the Sengoku and explores it thoroughly. It is a great small novel and is even praised by foreigners, despite being a clear propaganda piece. The cultural ramifications of this production may be massive."
