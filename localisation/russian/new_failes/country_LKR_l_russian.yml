  ##Political Advisors##
   LKR_great_reformer: "Nicholas Irons"
    LKR_great_reformer_political_desc: "The Advisor is a rather known figure in the administration run by the Lytch King. Born into a afluent family in Delsun, he went on to study abroad in several player-universities, which allowed him, as a mob, to become subject of several ideologies that have not yet made their way into the eastern continent. Returning home, he was appointed as the Head of Government by the Lytch King, due to his elevated education. With reformist ideals in mind, he is the main propagator of reform in the Realm."
   LKR_haren: "Doriel O'Haren"
    LKR_haren_political_desc: "Doriel is a rather interesting warlord. Born into a family of wealthy industrialists and factory-owners, he was quick to learn how the manufactorium of the realm works. When his father died and he inheritated his industrial empire, he went on to cooperate with other owners and as such, the entire province of Brans was now his own personal fiefdom. Everything crashed when the Lytch King decided to finnaly put an end to his little experiment, but he has opted to pledge his allegiance to the king, for then he can continue to do his work on a grander scale."
   LKR_jones: "Davy Jones"
    LKR_jones_political_desc: "Davy, oh Davy. A former-sailor turned warlord, returning home to his realm after he was excommunicated from the Hexus Navy. A tough bag of bones, he, alongside his crew, run the land like bandits. As for the coastal towns, they flourish because of the piracy. Most valuables are brought there, and Davy is sure to take his cut. Once the Lytch King came before him, and bested him at his own combat with a rag-tag team of subpar sailors, he has pledged his allegiance to him, becoming the first Grand Admiral of the Realm."
   LKR_bassfish: "George Bassfish"
    LKR_bassfish_political_desc: "George was an ordinary man, living and working on the largest farm inside all of the realm. Once the authority of the king broke down, and the regions went on to be ruled by warlords, he, alongside a council of farmers, took over the states of MG and Thermobreak. Over the course of a few years, he managed to outsmart every other farmer and rise to the top, becoming the most influencial farmer. He, unlike most other warlords, had no issue bowing down to the Lytch King once he came knocking."

Yet the last few decades have seen the workshops and their industrious workers driven ever harder in the name of revolutionary fervor. Even after the last king was deposed, the workload remained high leading to exhaustion. This negelct continues to lay the groundwork for bitter resentment."
   LKR_hewn_horse: "The Hewn Wolves"
    LKR_hewn_horse_desc: "The steppes of Deslun stand as the barrier between the western blue and the agriculturally rich Marrow Valley.

  southwestern_contest.1.d:0 "In the far Southwest of the Eastern Continent, Several villagers remain autonomous, thanks to our protection of the Villager Rights Act. But the Fallen Kingdom's Conflict has spread, and it seems some players escaping from the Conflict desire to begin settlement in the Southwest. We must now decide... do we allow the Southwestern Kingdom to expand, or is our claim to the Villager Rights Act more important?"
  southwestern_contest.2.d:0 "It appears, troubled times are ahead for the Southwestern Region. A new player group, known as the Southwestern Kingdom, have appeared in the Village of Tarles and are spreading false beliefs of player superiority. If we are to survive these new groups of players, we must act now to secure our Villager Neighbours."
  southwestern_contest.3.d:0 "As we settle in the Southwest, the Question of the Southern Empire's Villager Rights Act has come forward. However, it seems that the Southern Empire are unwilling to defend the Southwest, and we may now have free reign in the region. This is good news, but we are not the only Southwestern Nation vying for power. The Struggle to protect the East will now begin."
  southwestern_contest.4.d:0 "Terrible news is now afoot. It seems the Southern Empire has revoked their protection of the Southwest, undecided over whether to protect our Villager Neighbours. This means that it is likely the Lytch King will push forward his aims of reforming the Hexus Empire and Ending our sovereignty. Not only this problem, but now it appears soldiers from the Fallen Kingdom have landed on the Continent. We must now act to defend our Independence."
  southwestern_contest.5.d:0 "The Southwestern Contest is over. Whichever nations have the greatest influence in their local Villages may now strike against their Independence. After that, it is likely the Southwest will experience the bloodiest conflict since the Unification Wars. Peace is now a mere dream."
  southwestern_contest.6.d:0 "The Southwestern Region, currently under our Protection through the Villager Rights Act, was once a mighty Player Empire known as the Hexus Empire. It seems, an old Warlord remembering these times now seeks to strike at the Continent once again and restore it to its former glory. Should we defend our Villagers, or allow another Empire to rise?"
  
  ##EVENTS##
  LKR.0.d:0 "The Southwest bears the haunting scars of the devastation brought by the Unification Wars. Even though Herobrine never physically set foot in this territory, he cunningly directed hordes of monsters to lay siege upon the once-majestic Hexus Empire. Today, fragmented warlord states contest the scarce resources, remnants of a once-great civilization. Amidst this backdrop of chaos and ruin, the Lytch King stands, driven by a deep longing to resurrect the unity and glory of the Hexus Empire."
  LKR.1.d:0 "Within the domain of the Lytch King, the tumultuous Warlord States demand attention. Precious resources lie dormant, while petty disputes among aspiring tyrants hold us in the shadow of impoverishment left by the Empire's downfall. Decisive action is imperative, and only the Lytch King commands the might necessary to steer this course."
  LKR.2.d: "Willowhill, the largest town in the highly fertile Monstrous Grasslands, is a key battleground for restoring order. Doriel O'Haren leads a small militia protecting the critical town. The Lytch King faces a dilemma: exploit the weak flanks for a decisive victory, target the river crossing for the easiest concentration of force, or seek a truce to attempt to rekindle past unity."
  LKR.3.d:0 "Our Flanking strategy proved to be decisive in fighting O'Haren's forces. He was not expecting us to move through the Northern Swampland, which allowed us to make a decisive strike into Willowhill itself. The Remainder of O'haren's forces have fled north to Thermobreak. "
  LKR.4.d:0 "A direct frontal assault was a critical flaw in the Lytch King's Plans. O'Haren had prepared strong sets of defences around the Willowhill bridge, which allowed him to deal significant damage to our crossing troops. By the time they made it across the river, the majority of our forces were slaughtered."
  LKR.5.d:0 "Surprisingly, O'Haren and his band of farmers were incredibly willing to go to the negotiation table with us. After a few disagreements around fair compensation, O'haren declared his support for the Lytch King and loaves of Bread began moving towards Deslun"
  LKR.6.d:0 "Larencia, a fortified city known for its impenetrable defenses, is a prime target for expansion. Old Man Joe, the current leader of a band of misfits protecting the castle walls, must be confronted for us to seize the city. The approach to this siege will dictate the fate of the campaign. Bold tactics, brute force, or diplomacy, the choice remains with the Lytch King."
  LKR.7.d:0 "Our plan to force Joe's forces from the castle walls succeeded. The boldness and courage of his troops lured them easily towards our tactical positions in the Grasslands, allowing us to slowly pick them off as they left the city. Through disorganizing his forces, Joe was forced to retreat from the Larencian Stronghold."
  LKR.8.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, we were made completely unaware of a large stockpile of bows within Larencia. Thousands of residents flocked to the castle walls, Bolstering Joe's force and dealing heavy damage to our troops as we tried to scale the Castle. After suffering heavy losses, several divisions under the Lytch King's Command simply refused to follow orders."
  LKR.9.d:0 "Despite a clash seeming likely, Our king managed to seize a meeting with Joe inside Larencia. After demonstrating an element of Charisma by marching into Larencia without any protection, an agreement was made between the King and Joe for mutual unity under one nation."
  LKR.10.d:0 "A clash in Thermobreak was inevitable. The key Blacksmiths within the two towns made this a necessary conflict to restore the industrial capacity brought by the Hexus Empire. George Bassfish leads a highly mobile force that uses the rivers connecting the two towns for quick maneuvering. We could either try and Concentrate our forces on a single town, confront him directly on the rivers he controls, or attempt to sign an agreement for a mutual peace."
  LKR.11.d:0 "Our concentration of force proved too much for a warlord that intended to control all of his territory. By quickly overrunning Boilspring, his maneuverable force was cut off and disorganised, allowing us to pick off individual groups one by one."
  LKR.12.d:0 "Our maneuvers through the rivers were a disaster. We sufficiently lacked skilled forces to navigate through the streams, and a lack of boating supplies left many of our troops stuck in several locations. This allowed Bassfish's troops to quickly move around us, cutting our forces from one another allowing for a loss of communication. We still cannot find the locations of many of our Regiments."
  LKR.13.d:0 "As it turns out, all Bassfish needed was a stable currency. The economics between the two towns had been in turmoil since the fall of the Hexus Empire, with various forms of bartering, slavery and disorganised black markets forcing an Unstable economy. By setting a fixed currency under the Lytch King, the Thermobreak settlers happily embraced the Lytch King as their leader."
  LKR.14.d:0 "The City of Dewport is the Realm's only naval access, and several pirate groups stand ready to exploit that. Davy Jones, a common name within the region, dominates key groups within the state. His coercion spreads far and wide, meaning that movement anywhere close to his precious town will be watched. The best strategy is to maneuver through the Brans forests, allowing us the closest distance to the Port town. We could of course cross the Rosey Lake, a bold move sure to surprise Davy Jones. Alternatively, a small bribe may be all that is necessary to convince him to join our side."
  LKR.15.d:0 "Completely unaware, our maneuvers through the forests allowed us to enter the port town suddenly and unopposed. Rumours are circulating that as soon as Davy heard reports of forces at the town, he took a warship and sailed towards The Villager Confederation."
  LKR.16.d:0 "Our attempt to cross the Lake was a disaster. Davy Jones had prepared for this, with several mines and small fishing boats equipped with weapons to take out our transports. The Lytch King himself was almost forced to drown by a surprising cannonball through his cutter."
  LKR.17.d:0 "The Lytch king moved alone towards Dewport, entering as common scummery. Surprisingly, Davy Jones was aware of his presence, and invited him into his brewery. After some short discussion, it became apparent that Davy always wished to be an Admiral of a grand imperial fleet under the hexus empire. Through some easy convincing, Jones declared his loyalty to the Lytch King and submitted his fleet to his command."
  LKR.18.d:0 "In the illustrious city of Deslun, the Warlords convened, welcomed by a lavish banquet hosted by the Lytch King. It was a momentous occasion, for the King was set to proclaim the Unity of the Realms. Yet, the fragility of this newfound unity was evident. Only through comprehensive reform could the Lytch King genuinely establish a robust governance. At this banquet, he intended to unveil his plans to integrate the diverse warlords into his administration. His vision of resurrecting the Hexus Empire hinges on forging a united front with the nobility. Time will tell whether this Commonwealth will succeed."
  LKR.19.d:0 "Five pivotal advisors are now at the forefront of transforming the Lytch King's domain into a contemporary state. The once-chaotic council of warlords is evolving into a structured government, adept at allocating resources and enhancing the well-being of its citizens. While there's still a journey ahead, this marks a significant stride towards establishing a southwestern commonwealth."
  LKR.20.d:0 "With a proper council of players and monsters, one key group is excluded from our governance. Often left behind by the more beaurocratic and controlling groups in the overworld, Our local villagers must be considered to be incorporated in our Government. This could potentially boost our relations with the Villages of the Overworld, however, this will concede some power from our player investors."
  LKR.21.d:0 "With a new social order established, it is time for Democracy. We have a variety of candidates available for our selection, each providing us with a unique policy direction. It is time for the people to decide an elected leader."
  LKR.22.d:0 "The Lytch King has presided over our realm with steadfastness since the Hexus Empire's demise. His reign has been a beacon of stability in the turbulent wake of the warlord era. Having adroitly steered our state through its darkest times, it is only fitting that power continues to reside with him. With his guidance, a luminous future awaits, and the Empire will once again rise to its former glory."
  LKR.23.d:0 "In the annals of the overworld, there has never been a sovereign realm ruled by witches. Yet, as we ascend to prominence, we stand at a crossroads. For centuries, we have faced oppression at the hands of the players. The question we must now grapple with is: do we seek retribution, or do we extend an olive branch? Given their vast industrial capacities, it might be prudent to forge a path of reconciliation and collaboration. The future can be brighter if we choose unity."
  LKR.24.d:0 "Beneath the towering shadow of the Lytch King lies a well-guarded secret. His meteoric ascent to power in the overworld was not solely a testament to his prowess but the result of a clandestine pact with the realm's witches. With their potent brews, they granted him unparalleled charisma, strength, and fortune. In exchange, he assured them a significant degree of power and autonomy within the realm.\n\nWhile the Lytch King may don all public accolades and titles, behind the scenes, the scales of power are tipping subtly yet significantly. Empowered by this newfound status, the witches have seized the moment, and the Coven has emerged—a formidable alliance of the southwestern witches. United as never before, they stand poised to influence the course of the realm's destiny."
  LKR.25.d:0 "The Warlord Era is finally settled. The Lytch King has unified the Realm, and we may now have a chance to reform a Unified Southwestern Continent."
  LKR.26.d:0 " The echoing cadence of the Lytch Troops' march towards Peatcliff sent waves of astonishment through Archduke. It was an audacious move, one he hadn't expected the Lytch King to take. Without a moment's hesitation, Archduke rallied his forces, steeling them for an imminent face-off in the very heart of the town. The stage was set for a confrontation that would be etched in the echoes of history."
  LKR.27.d:0 "In the undulating hills that cradled Peatcliff, two vast armies stood at a tense standoff, their gazes locked in mutual defiance. At the heart of this sea of steel and anticipation, two figures emerged, ostensibly to parley before the inevitable storm of battle.\n\nBut in an act of unprecedented audacity, the Lytch King cast aside his bow and boldly strode into the very jaws of Archduke's forces. A palpable silence fell upon the land, so dense it seemed the very world held its breath.\n\nThen, from the ranks of the Archduke's soldiers, a lone voice pierced the quiet. "Long Live the Hexus Empire!" The cry resonated, amplifying as it spread, until it became a deafening chorus of unity. Thousands surged forward, not in aggression, but in jubilation, embracing comrades they had once viewed as adversaries.\n\nAmidst this spontaneous reunion, Archduke and the Lytch King exchanged a silent, meaningful glance. Words were superfluous, for it was clear that the will of their people had already charted the course of their intertwined destinies."
  LKR.28.d:0 "The Lytch King's Claim to be the restorer of the Hexus Empire was nothing but in title. When his forces moved into Peatcliff, thousands of his loyal subjects began to defect to Archduke. It seems, meeting the warlord in confrontation has only convinced our armed forces that Archduke is the true crown of the Hexus Empire."
  LKR.29.d:0 "The time has come, brothers and sisters. The Lytch King's Realm must be no more, and our Witchdom will rise. The Lytch King is too drunk on his power, and now is the chance to kill him and his advisors once and for all."
  LKR.30.d:0 "We have recieved, an Odd request from the Skeleton Land of the Lytch King. our small fishing territory, Phisland, has been given considerable value by the Southwestern Empire. Shall we conduct a sale to them, in this dire time when we critically need financial gain?"
  LKR.31.d:0 "The Fallen Kingdom has agreed to sell the Phisland State to us. This will give a strong Industrial Base for our Canning Industry."
  LKR.32.d:0 "Unfortunately, it appears Phisland still holds value to the Eastern Kingdom. We must consider seizure via other means."
  LKR.33.d:0 "A messenger from a country in the far Southwest has come to us, proposing a simple pact. Although our ties with the Southwest have always been limited, perhaps now is the time to increase our grip in the Region."
  LKR.34.d:0 "The fall of the Hexus Empire left a highly competitive southwestern economy and tore it to shreds. Ruined Factories, decaying railways and Unmotivated workers prevent us from ever achieving our potential. Action must be taken to improve this Situation."
  LKR.35.d:0 "We have united our Warlords in the Southwest, However, we now must do battle with the truly independent Warlords of the Hexus Empire. Deadcoast, a northern Pirate state that has achieved great profit during the Pirate Golden Age, is now set to strike against us as a newly unified threat. We must pay close attention to our Northern Border, as raids will begin to escalate."
  LKR.36.d:0 "It appears that a new nation to our South is beginning to formalise itself. The Lytch King's Realm, established from a former noble of the Hexus Empire, is surely set to challenge our Authority. We must take action against their power."
  LKR.37.d:0 "The Lytch King has approached us with an offer of Unity. Should we honour this alliance, or continue our path of Autonomy?"
  LKR.38.d:0 "Skullvania has rejected our offer of an Alliance. It seems, unification must be brought by force."
  LKR.39.d:0 "Our Client State on the mainland, Falconia, has been met by an outside force in the Skeleton Empire. Although we have no direct commitments, perhaps it would be wise to send them sizable forces to hold the line."
  LKR.40.d:0 "We have suceeded in the Border Struggle against Falconia! we must now decide whether to press our advantage, or seek complacency to not disturb the Enchanted Lands"
  LKR.41.d:0 "The Falconian Villagers, likely with support from the Enchanted Lands, has beat back our raiding forces. This puts us in an unfortunate place, held back by a lowly Villager State."
  LKR.42.d:0 "Our conflict has concluded with the Lytch King. hopefully we have resolved this in a successful manner."
  LKR.43.d:0 "We have successfully ended the Cult of Hexus, brought by these terrible player loyalists. We can finally pursue an independent policy not tainted by old Hexian Ties."
  LKR.44.d:0 "As our influence expands throughout the Western Empires, we stand at a crossroads. Do we seek to forge bonds with the Southern Empire by establishing a presence in their capital, or prioritize rejuvenating the storied heart of the Old Imperian Capital?"
