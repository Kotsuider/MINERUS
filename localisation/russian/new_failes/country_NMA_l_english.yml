 NMA_fultone: "Fultone"
 NMA_fultone_desc: "The Military Authority doesn't really have a leader, as it is almost entirely composed of soldiers and knights. Usually, the leader is the highest ranking military officer, who is currently Fultone. Fultone leads the Authority with an iron fist, and has prepared it for the Third Unification War. Whether or not it will be able to stop Herobrine is another matter entirely."
 
 NMA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "FUR DIE EHRE! The Military Authority was formed to fight Herobrine, and after his defeat they continued to guard the north. With little industry or political standing, they make a weak line against a superior foe. Indeed, many believe Herobrine to be dead and much aid has been cut off. As the south breaks apart into anarchy, the Authority is left as the abandoned first line against complete destruction. Even the Southern Player Empire has slowed its stream of supplies to us."

As of right now, we are locked on a war against cultism, with Herobrine-Aligned Guerrillas spurting and harming our military control of the region. The authority is on the constant hunt for these cells and will do everything to its capacity to destroy them."
