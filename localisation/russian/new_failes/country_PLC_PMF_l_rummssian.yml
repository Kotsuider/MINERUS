  plc.event.1.t: "The History of the Red Rose Union Prt. 1" #CHANGE CONTINENT NAME
   plc.event.1.desc: "Eastern Continent was always a wild land with opportunities. Before mass colonization, many adventurers came to this land seeking the unknown, but when the Nether War ended, many western imperialists drew attention to these unconquered territories. That time they also began to haunt demiplayers who helped them win that war. We are descendants of these players who took part of a dangerous journey to find a new safe haven.\n\nOur ancestors firstly created a commune called the Crazy Adventure, but when Herobrine began his second crusade, we needed to create some government. We were able to stay neutral in this war, but it hit us too. When Herobrine fled the Eastern Continent, the remnants of his zombie army regained its form and created a new faction called “Undead Lands”. The first player who saw the danger was one of our admins of the Crazy Adventure, Polski Crafter. He convinced many players to crush the zombies in their roots. With the help of the leader of Crazy Adventure, Puzonekk, they started the first expedition to wipe out the zombies. It drove the zombies far away from our borders, but it didn’t destroy them."
   plc.event.1.a: "Continue"
    plc.event.101.d: "Zombie Horde quickly regained itself and continued the attacks on the border. The players performed several expeditions in the following years. After each expedition, the Zombie Horde would grow stronger and regain itself faster. Crazy Adventure, in desperation, sought help from surrounding communities and together they would come to a deal with the monsters' clans to better protect themselves.\n\nAt this moment Polski Crafter decided to evacuate everyone which drove Puzonekk mad, as he thought that the Crazy Adventure would stand forever. They began evacuation of our homeland and the surrounding communities towards the north. When they reached the North Coast they established a state where citizens chose the red rose as their symbol of unity. As the man who led the March, Polski Crafter was put in power by the newborn union.\n\nAfter fifteen years of expansion, the Union is shown as an icon of good management, but this is an illusion. The Red Rose Union is a bureaucratic disaster. The economy is shattering and most citizens don't have the right to vote. This chaos led to an opposition against the rule of Polski Crafter. They want to see the Union rise and reach the glory it was supposed to get."
    plc.event.101.a: "Nice story"

  plc.event.2.t: "There are No Friends"
   plc.event.2.desc: "With the worsening political situation in the union, friends are a premium luxury. After the arrival to these lands members of many communities needed to work together to build something from nothing and even with the current inhabitants' resistance. They began building their future, but without resources, work was slow so after making the first settlement Polski Crafter decided to create a council where representatives will get their own goal and will seek support from others to achieve it. The first Council had 15 leaders which most memorable were: Ja Hol's Investment and Monster Clans' Rights Group, the Crazy Adventure Warriors, Brudziu Settlers and Chaos Fishers.\n\nThey supported each other and at the end they achieved their goals. Brudziu created his own town, Chaos has made his own fleet and Ja Hol attracted foreign investors."
   plc.event.2.a: "Continue"
    plc.event.102.d: "But nothing is perfect. Puzonekk loyalist officers were forcibly retired which make the Crazy Adventure Warriors quit the Council and when Ja Hol, whose the second goal has been to give intelligent monsters rights, has been assigned to northern campaign against forest beasts, he proclaimed himself a warlord of this territory and isn't showing at the Council meeting. The current leaders of outside the Council opposition are Puzonekk and Skarabii, union leader. With the tyrannical rule of Polski Crafter, he has narrowed his friends list.\n\nSkarabii has risen from villagers' movement as a union boss who has been supporting villagers since the refugees from Crazy Adventure arrived fifteen years ago. The villagers built the foundation of the nation and after finishing their task, were useless to the government. Skarabii wants to deeply reform the union and fight the various monopolies who exploit the resources and citizens alike.\n\nThe situation is escalating quickly and sooner or later we will see these two groups unite to form a great opposition to Crafter's tyrannical rule."

  plc.event.3.t: "One Man Choice" #CHANGE CONTINENT NAME
   plc.event.3.desc: "Ja Hol is a politician, businessman, architect and warlord. In one word, man of many faces. Although his first face was an architect, during the time of the Crazy Adventure, he became friends with many influential admins like Polski Crafter or Puzonekk. When the Zombie Horde began their expansion, he joined the first expedition as a volunteer who supported warriors with blocks and food. In the next expeditions he would even take part in battles as a soldier, but with connections to several admins he was promoted the rank of officer. After success as an officer, he was promoted to the rank of commander.\n\nAfter the seventh expedition, Ja Hol was assigned as a political ambassador to other communities. He was one of the main causes of the community to make a deal with other monster clans, who helped a lot in the war against the zombies. During these meetings he worked closely with the local monster clans and improved relations."
   plc.event.3.a: "Continue"
    plc.event.103.d: "After the Long March he became a leader of a movement to attract foreign investors and give monsters rights. As his architect career was running well, he has made many friends across all dimensions. Quickly many foreign investors put a lot of money in the newborn Union which helped a lot in building up a new state. However, Ja Hol's second goal was neglected by Polski Crafter. When Ja Hol was sent to the north to fight the forest beasts and expand the union, he proclaimed himself a warlord and he has never come back to the Union City again.\n\nTwo days ago, it turned out that isolated from the capital Ja Hol is desperately needed by Polski Crafter to help him fight the opposition who are besieging the capital. Ja Hol is in a dilemma as he supports the opposition, which can at least give rights to monsters, but he fears Puzonekk's authoritarianism. On the other hand he can help Polski Crafter, but without opposition Crafter can implement more laws where monsters will live in fear of extermination. What should this man do to protect his family?"

Their rights were then protected by commander Ja Hol, who would in the future become deputy of the Council, and the special group called "Ja Hol's Investment and Monster Clans' Rights Group" which failed its task.\nWhen Ja Hol was sent to the north to fight the forest beasts, he successfully defeated them and proclaimed himself as a warlord of this region. Nobody tried to fight him as he had million monsters under his command ready to proclaim an independence.\nThey were silent to the point when opposition against the harsh rule of Polski Crafter was rising up. Ja Hol quickly gathered clans' warlords and together they wrote document called "Monster Rigths Act". It was mostly done by Ja Hol, but it needed to be advertised by monsters so the face of this act became the various clan leaders. It was rejected as fear of monsters was still very high among the players.\nAnd after the Blue Shirts arise the possibility of passing the act is more real than before. The wrong decision can cost us even a rebellion so we must choose wisely."
