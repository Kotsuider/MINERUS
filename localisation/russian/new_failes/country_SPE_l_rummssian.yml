   SPE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "LONG LIVE THE SOUTHERN EMPIRE! The Southern Player Empire was formed around 0148, shortly after the end of the first nether war. The Empire was formed solely for the protection of the overworld against the Nether, but as each year passes and no signs of any sort of nether activity, the empire has ever so slowly decreased in power over time. Over 7 years have passed since the nether invasion, but rumours are circulating that something has changed, and the Southern Player Empire must stay strong."
