   SWL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: ""EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE" or so the old saying goes. For centuries our people have defined this phrase each generation in their own way. For every Teillian it has always meant life, liberty, and the pursuit purpose. Long have we sought adventure to seek ourselves and return to our kindred reborn. For always and eternity we will seek to thrive.\nAnd for all this our way of life has not adapted even as greed, corruption, and our lost youth threatens to undermine all we stand for. The tides are coming. Will we weather the coming storm or falter in the face of change; buried and forgotten?"

 ###Ideas/Flags/Concerns###
  ##Starting Ideas##
   SWL_lost_generation: "The Lost Generation"
    SWL_lost_generation_desc: "For centuries our citizens have fought in conflict both at home and abroad. It has become so entrenched in our culture that many young players travel abroad rather than have families of their own. This has caused a drain on our population and the capacity of our confederation to function.\n\nIn recent years the conflict against the horde has taken many, returning only those who have been too scarred to fight. This leaves us with a large absence; a lost generation that is a drain on our communities."
   SWL_strained_economy_3: "Strained Economy"
    SWL_strained_economy_3_desc: "Our ability to trade with the outside world is the lifeblood of our economy. Through our major exports of fruit, lumber, and metal we have largely been able to trade for the goods we desperately lack. The resulting flow of wealth and goods has done wonders for the standard of living of our communities.\n\nIn recent years however we have suffered loss at the hands of pirates and trade competitors. We have stemmed the effects thus far, but by our projections economic collapse is inevitable. We must prepare for this eventuality by any means necessary."
   SWL_wood_war_legacy: "Legacy of the Wood Wars"
    SWL_wood_war_legacy_desc: "In the not so distant past we have had various disagreements amongst ourselves and with our neighbors. The most notable of these altercations have led to significant bloodshed. The resulting tensions continue to mar relations between all involved.\n\nEven now the inability of our government to address these issues gives rise to those who whisper of change whether the means justify the ends or not. Should we ill minister this developing situation the legacies of the past may result in unforeseen consequences."
  ##Normal Idea##

   SWL_strained_economy_5: "Booming Economy"
    SWL_strained_economy_5_desc: ""
   SWL_wood_war_legacy_reduced: "Road to Recovery"
    SWL_wood_war_legacy_reduced_desc: "In the not so distant past we have had various disagreements amongst ourselves and with our neighbors. The most notable of these altercations have led to significant bloodshed. The resulting tensions continue to mar relations between all involved.\n\nAs the political fallout has come to rest the political landscape has come to a quiet standstill. While our troubles are by no means over, we can rest assured that civil unrest will not explode in the near future. With time, perhaps these issues will finally come to rest."
   SWL_wood_war_memorial: "Forgiven, Not Forgotten"
    SWL_wood_war_memorial_desc: "In the not so distant past we have had various disagreements amongst ourselves and with our neighbors. The most notable of these altercations have led to significant bloodshed. The resulting tensions continue to mar relations between all involved.\n\nWhile the majority of the population has at last come to terms with their grudges recovery will never truly heal the wounds of the past. At the very least we can work together for a better tomorrow without resorting to catastrophic infighting. Let us never forget what brought us to the present and protect that which we hold dear."
   SWL_agricultural_revival: "Agricultural Revival"
    SWL_agricultural_revival_desc: "One of the key tenants brought forward by Afons of Colaver was his policy of self sufficiency. While governments may change hands, it is hoped that this policy will sustain us for generations to come."
   SWL_strained_economy_temp_stem: "Suspended Economy"
    SWL_strained_economy_temp_stem_desc: "Our ability to trade with the outside world is the lifeblood of our economy. Through our major exports of fruit, lumber, and metal we have largely been able to trade for the goods we desperately lack. The resulting flow of wealth and goods has done wonders for the standard of living of our communities.\n\nWe have managed to stem the bleeding further with a temporary cessation of projective buying. While this will obviously cause issues, we have managed to save some money in the process. This should allow us to divert funding to projects that will stabilize our economy."
   SWL_strained_economy_temp_reduced: "Recovered Economy"
    SWL_strained_economy_temp_reduced_desc: "Our ability to trade with the outside world is the lifeblood of our economy. Through our major exports of fruit, lumber, and metal we have largely been able to trade for the goods we desperately lack. The resulting flow of wealth and goods has done wonders for the standard of living of our communities.\n\nWith our recent economic developments we have managed to stabilize our economic situation. It may be wise to reestablish trade relations abroad now that we can afford to do so."
   SWL_strained_economy_temp_thriving: "Waystop of the East"
    SWL_strained_economy_temp_thriving_desc: "Our ability to trade with the outside world is the lifeblood of our economy. Through our major exports of fruit, lumber, and metal we have largely been able to trade for the goods we desperately lack. The resulting flow of wealth and goods has done wonders for the standard of living of our communities.\n\nAt last we have achieved an economic model that will sustain and allow us to thrive. With wealth at our disposal we can even begin to tax and profit off passerby. Let the world envy our economic might!"

This has caused a drain on our population and the capacity of our confederation to function.\n\nWe have begun the process of organizing both our expats and their ideas to sort out our woes.

It has become so entrenched in our culture that many young players travel abroad before settling down for the latter part of their lives. When they inevitably return, they come learned and experienced in the ways of the world.\n\nWe will never be able to truly subvert the cons of this time honored tradition, but we have laid the foundations that those who travel abroad to seek themselves will return and be better for it. They in turn can share their wisdom with others and strengthen the whole."

 ###National Focuses###
  ##Storyline Branch - Initial##
   SWL_S0000: "The Congress of 648"
    SWL_S0000_desc: "With the passing of the New Year's Celebration's the sovereign communities of the Azure are preparing their delegates to meet at the annual Fordwater Congress to discuss matters of importance to the Teilian Confederation. This meeting promises to be of the utmost importance as calamity will inevitably befall the country in the near future."
    SWL_ES.000000.t: "A New Year, A New Horizon"
     SWL_ES.000000.d: "The New Year has passed leaving players across the region exhausted from the festivities. The prior night's snowfall had been a most welcome reprieve from the struggles of life in the Azure. Schlatt would not miss the rowdy workers, the stubborn officials, or the lack of Emeralds. When the moon rose later in the evening he would be long gone with barrels of what he had gained in tow, off to old pastures.\n\nThe thought of going home instilled the mogul with excitement. Sure he'd have to deal with the competition, but if his business had lasted this long in this home away from home he would surely manage. The savvy businessman would at last be where it all started with old and new friends alike. The thought of encountering Stalldisks and Hankcoin scams would give him pause, but it was nothing that couldn't be brushed off. It would all be worth it in the end. Maybe he would reopen Schlatt Co or even retire. No matter what with the stacks of emeralds in his possession, the sky would be the limit."
     SWL_ES.000000.a: "To boldly go north!"
    SWL_ES.000001.t: "The 34th Confederal Convention"
     SWL_ES.000001.d: "As the delegates took their seats in Fordwater Hall, Mr. Bayleaf replayed the speech he had practiced for the entire week repeatedly. As speaker, it would be his duty to lead the charge towards a miracle and away from what would likely be the country's darkest hour. All his life, the lives of his parents, and those before them had led to this moment. If the congress failed here when the Teilian world was on the verge of what seemed a dark age, it would certainly plunge into irrecoverable despair.\n\nAs the last of the delegates had taken their seats, the bell rested in the steeple of Fordwater Hall rung thirteen times. Bayleaf rose from his seat, cleared his throat, and turned to address the gathered delegates."
     SWL_ES.000001.a: "Delegates of the Congress, I welcome you.\n§GNew Decisions Have Been Unlocked!§!"
     SWL_ES.000001.cett: "With the §Y43rd Confederal Convention§! having taken place, the delegates are §Otemporarily empowered§! to conduct §YAffairs of State§! on behalf of the confederation for §Gbetter§! or §Rworse§!. Peruse the decisions for more details."
     SWL_congress_unlocked: "§CCongress has Convened§!"
   SWL_S0100: "Cannibalize the TECA"
    SWL_S0100_desc: "For almost a century, the Teilian Eastern Customs Agency has had it's hand in backdoor dealings and is a known source of corruption within the weak Confederal government. We should repurpose what we can and sell the remaining assets to private buyers to fund other projects."
    SWL_S0100_cett: "Will receive §G50,000 Emeralds§! from asset sales.\n§OThe §YFordwater Estate§! will not be pleased.§!"
   SWL_S0101: "Empower the TECA"
    SWL_S0101_desc: "The Teilian Eastern Customs Agency is critical to our ability to effectively regulate the global facing element of our economy. If we invest our time and effort into stamping out corruption from within, we could revitalize it as an effective apparatus of any future government."
    SWL_S0101_cttt: "Requires §Y80,000 Emeralds§! in the coffers."
    SWL_S0101_cett: "Will lose §R80,000 Emeralds§! from agency spending.\n§G§YThe Delegate from Fordwater§! will support §gBayleaf§!.§!"
   SWL_S0102: "Restoring Colaver"
    SWL_S0102_desc: "Colaver is the heart of our woodworking and shipwright trades. Of recent times various corporations and interests have bled the city dry leaving the city a barely functional husk. We must appoint a committee to solve this situation lest it spell doom for our flagging economy."
    SWL_ES.010200.t: "The Matter of Colaver"
     SWL_ES.010200.d: "After many days of debate, the committee charged with finding solutions to revitalizing Colaver has reached an impasse. There are three major camps of thought on the matter.\n\nOne group wishes to improve the infrastructure in order to better allow commerce, people, and goods to flow in the region. No doubt the local businesses will be thankful for the cost reductions on their operations. Such a project however will take time and resources which will cost a fair amount of emeralds and not address other issues we currently face.\n\nAnother solution involves dealing with the workforce directly. In this way work hours would be shortened by law, unions would be given an official channel for grievance, and quality of life would be improved by public projects. This however will lead to slower production and inefficiency at the cost of appeasing general unrest.\n\nThe third option presented involves buying out businesses and creating a government run enterprise. This will of course create jobs and create competition in monopolized sectors. However many fear this will lead to unforeseen consequences and a sink hole of funding."

  ##Temp Political Branch##
   SWL_P0000: "Rocky Road to Nationhood"
    SWL_P0000_desc: "It is 648. The road to nationhood is often paved with the best intentions, yet not all roads are as smooth or lead to the best of places; few do. The coming turmoil will certainly see to that. No matter what happens it is imperative the Confederation as a whole become the better for it. Who will ultimately lead the new government is up to fate and the whims of chance."
    SWL_P0000_ctt: "Congress has stabilized or the crisis has passed."
    SWL_EP.000000.t: "Troubles in Fordwater"
     SWL_EP.000000.d: "This morning Merryweather, several members of her personal guard, and dozens of congressional deputies entered Fyrdwater Hall to arrest it's members on charges of corruption and treason. The majority of it's members have been detained save for the representatives from Colaver and Lapiza. While Morrigan as congressional marshal is empowered to make such an accusation, this act was done without due process and is thus illegal. Some murmur that his is nothing short of a power grab if not an outright coup d'tat.\n\nCurrently the marshal's intensions are unknown though we suspect a message be sent by late afternoon at the soonest. Until such a time however it is of the utmost importance that the situation be contained. The local militia has already taken up positions around the blocks near Fyrdwater Hall and Captain Gareth has been summoned back from leave.\n\nIt will take some time to prepare any response, so the militia has decided to wait for Gareth to return before taking further action. It is strange that today a seemingly normal day would lead to such unusual events. Aside from a few stockades occupying the streets no one seems to mind and there is no panic as of yet."
     SWL_EP.000000.a: "Err... Business as usual then?"
    SWL_EP.000001.t: "Siege at Fyrdwater Hall"
     SWL_EP.000001.d: "It's been about a week since the Hall has been occupied. The occupying marshal's forces made contact with the militia's stockade at Fyrd Street two days ago and requested that the militia allow them to pass. The militia sergeant refused and after a terse verbal altercation between both sides, the stockade was fired upon. A short firefight ensued with casualties suffered on both sides. Thankfully there have been no deaths reported as of yet. There have been similar incidents all week with similar results. The militia have managed to acquire and set up some TNT cannons loaned to them by Tarlenian mercenaries of questionable motive.\n\nWhen Commander Gareth arrived this morning the militia received a letter from Merryweather. She has reaffirmed the charges against the Congress and has demanded that the militia stand down by nightfall. To make matters more complex the Unitarian leader MacDonal has come to the city and seeks an audience with Commander Gareth. He claims to have important information regarding this escalating situation and wishes to help."
     SWL_EP.000001.a: "So what does this all mean?"
    SWL_EP.000002.t: "A Fateful Decision"
     SWL_EP.000002.d: "The situation is thus...\n\nIf Gareth wishes, he can order a bombardment of Fyrdwater Hall, attempt to storm the building, and arrest Merryweather. This is likely to put the congressional representatives in danger and outrage both their respective constituents and the general public. Furthermore there is no guarantee of success.\n\nThere is also the option of ascending to Merryweather's request which may lead to unexpected results. We are unsure of the marshals intentions and this may lead to something that will haunt us later.\n\nThe increasingly desperate knocking and please from the door are a third option as MacDonal can be heard demanding to be let in to help us. Whatever he has in mind while well minded may make the government look weak and result in unforeseen consequences for the future of the confederation.\n\nChoose wisely for the fate of the Azure hangs in the balance."
     SWL_EP.000002.a: "Commence Shelling! We will not surrender."
     SWL_EP.000002.b: "Stand Down! There is nothing we can do."
     SWL_EP.000002.c: "Stop hammering ya bloc head and come in!"
   SWL_P0100: "The Rise of Socialism"
    SWL_P0100_desc: "The rise of the Unitarian party has caused much upheaval in the nation and threatens a crisis of government. Perhaps it is time for a new way of thinking, a way that favors the people over the corrupt whims of our current leadership. Afons of Colaver is the man who will lead us to a better tomorrow. A vote for the everyman is a vote for the future."
   SWL_P0101: "The Federalist Reforms"
    SWL_P0101_desc: "It's clear to all that our Congress does not have the power to do it's job. It's high time we embraced a centralized federal authority who can better steer the wheel of state. Who better to lead us than one who always kept us together; Yvaine Wright; the one leader who can forge a government for all? A vote for her is a vote for the republic."
   SWL_P0102: "The Confederal Reforms"
    SWL_P0102_desc: "Our Confederation has withstood all challenges before it and survived, yet this streak of success cannot last forever without able leadership. We need a wise candidate who will ensure we transform the congress to meet our modern needs. David Bayleaf is that stalwart figure and a great politician. Reelect Bayleaf, the most qualified man to steer the ship of state."
   SWL_P0103: "The Unitary Restoration"
    SWL_P0103_desc: "[SWL_P0103_desc]"
     SWL_P0103_undecided_desc: "The Unitarian party has found our government to be insufficient to carry out it's duties and feels it has neglected our long held traditions for far too long. It is time we came together to restore that which upholds our us. With Macdonal and Merryweather at the head, we will return to our olden roots. Vote for the return of our past. Vote Macdonal and Merryweather."
     SWL_P0103_morrigan_desc: "It is abundantly clear that Congress and by extent the Confederation has failed to uphold it's oaths to the people it serves. It is high time we regained that which we lost; our dignity. There is only one person who cna lead us to that golden horizon. Morrigan Merryweather will lead us to a grand future. Follow our great matriarch to glory! ...because no one else ever will."
     SWL_P0103_macdonal_desc: "With the betrayal of our trust by the fey willed Merryweather, we are left in a crisis that requires a careful hand that can guide us to a brighter future of strength and self-reliance that we may never again fall to crisis. Owen Macdonal is that man. An able administrator and great speaker to lead us. Vote for Macdonal to restore our integrity. With him, yes we can."
   SWL_P0200: "Subduing Political Strife"
    SWL_P0200_desc: "While it may be distasteful to some, it is important that we ensure that we never again come to blows as we have. We should educate our youth to avoid the mistakes of the past by teaching them about our estranged past. It is better to be wise than ignorant in such matters."
   SWL_P0201: "A Central Government"
