  ##Bookmark/Intro##
 TAB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "PURITY OF WILL! The Arbeiter Brigade holds a unique place in the Overworld, while not formally being an independent nation, it holds enough autonomy to formally break free from the Construction Authority if they deem it neccessary. Travelling Far and Wide, Mattu and his loyal followers lead the Prisoners and Pirates of the Player Empires and force them to develop the ruined wasteland that is the North. However, with Mattu's Tough Leadership comes resistance, and one of his right hand men are set to stand against his beliefs to bring Security to the Fragile Arbeiter Community."

  TAB_mattu: "Mattu"
  TAB_mattu_desc: "Ich frage euch: Wollt ihr den totalen Krieg?! Mattu is the Son of a Veteran of the Unification Wars, and has inherited all of their beliefs including a deep loyalty to Imperia. Far from home, Mattu enjoys his Autonomy from his Native Lands and his Pseudo Empire established under the nose of the Construction Authority. Converting this Autonomy into a true Empire will be difficult, but perhaps someday the Crown of Imperia will land on Mattu's Head."
  TAB_pirtey: "Pirtey"
  TAB_pirtey_desc: "Pirtey was exiled from Wolfland after a major political purge. Since then, he has traveled the world, arguing for socialism in a world where none exists. Despite their ideological differences, Pirtey and Mattu managed to work together to organise the Brigade and provide some of the best Building Projects the North has ever seen. However, the Ideological Boundaries are starting to crack and confrontation is inevitable."
  TAB_fred: "Father Ryan"
  TAB_fred_desc: "Religion holds an Interesting place within the Arbeiter Brigade, as the tough working conditions often require a larger-than-life figure to keep up the motivation of the Workers. Father Ryan is a Devoted Follower of Notch, Leading the Largest Religious Group in the Brigades Territories. Located in the Small Town of Torrana, the teachings of Father Ryan have allowed a small community to blossom giving the Brigade a formal Home away from their Worker Camps in other Nations. Mattu respects the value of Religion, and while not following Notch himself can understand the value of a godlike following."
  TAB_mith: "Mith"
  TAB_mith_desc: "Mith is a faithful General to the Arbeiter Brigade and an Ex-Imperian Soldier who found themselves disgruntled with the lack of career progress for outsiders to the Royal Family. With promise in Mattu's Arbeiter Troops, Mith Joined the Battalion and successfully became one of the highest ranks in the Brigade. If Mattu were to pass for whatever reason, his successor would surely be this Imperian Underdog."
