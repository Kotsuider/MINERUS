 #Character
 THO_father_herodus_desc: "§CWITH NOTCH WE WILL STRIVE§! \n Born from a Devout Notchist Seeker Family in 601 in Windreign; Herodus Bayleaf Goldwell, moved to Playerehem when he was only 7. He grew up to find a love in History, Geopolitics and Theology. He was always a charismatic and trustworthy person according to his peers. He joined the Grand Church of Notch in 629 as a Deacon, but he quickly rose to the top, acquiring priesthood and later on becoming an archbishop. After the death of Father Dmitri, who had led the nation for decades, Herodus saw the opportunity to become the Grand Notchist Priest, the leader of Emereth. After a vote among the cardinals, the charismatic Archbishop persuaded the election to his favour. At last, he rose to become the leader of the Notchists in 632. \n \n Although his charismatic and seemingly loving personality, some may dare to say that this is just a facade. His charismatic persona hides his true intentions; shall them be world hegemony? Or reforming notchism in his own views? No one knows. As of now, he is the best we can have for a leader..."

 #Events
 tho.customtt2: "§RBlood Across the Overworld§!"
 tho.customtt1: "§RTHE SINNERS WILL PAY.§!"
 tho.1.d: "After the fall of the crooked Herobrine Troops, The Northeast was reorganized at once. The Grand Northern Army carved up the territories, dividing it into the Free City of Starzenburg, the Northeastern Military Authority and the League of generals. All to defend against a possible cultist uprising. The Arbeiters and Saherita too joined up, willing to fight back against Herobrine's Heresy. And this is where the Cult of Notch Arose. Founded in 540, led by Father Alexander, The Cult was one of the Governments that were later stablished by the GNA; it was a true safehaven for the notchists to unite against Herobrine cultism, and for believers in the faith to organize with the GNA to combat cultism in its entirety. \n \n However, the settlements in Emereth, the Promised Land of the notchists, grew into something bigger that the GNA could handle. The cult turned into a fully functional nation, with two grand cities populated by believers and devout notchists from all around the overworld. This led to the Grand Northern Army granting our region complete autonomy in 593. This marked the transition of the Cult from an semi-autonomous Anti-Herobrine government to an equal, independent and fully self-sufficient nation. The wish to combat heresy mantained the newly founded nation in the Northern Reconstruction Alliance. \n \n Nowadays, we are one of the beacons of pilgramage and notchists believers in the overworld. We are true crusaders of faith, with our knights stablishing total order over herobrine cultism in the Promised Lands. We hold steadfast relations with the Admins, for whom reside our mighty lord Notch."
 tho.2.d: "The West had fallen under a terrible curse... The crooked and perverted heretics of the north organized their army and whoring under their leader 'Herobrine', they sold their souls for a degenerate cause. The heresy left thousands, no... tens of thousands, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, displaced, multilated and dead. The Northeast, under the Grand Northern Army and the Reconstruction Authority pushed back the heretics out of the lands, destroying Herobrine's ambition in taking over the west. \n \n Later on, it'd spread the foul hands of disorder and terror in the east. The Second Unification War destroyed the once shiny East. The Eastern Kingdom's grasp in their rightful lands was betrayed by their clay, for which rose monsters that destroyed and wrecked havoc. The once lively Hexus Empire too feel for the pests of the diseased Rothold, and the preying eyes of Herobrine's ambition. Their armies would soon fall. The King of the Fallen Eastern Continent led a special forces group which destroyed Herobrine and led him back once and for all to his wretched island. \n \n Despite all his defeats, there are rumors; folk tales and insights from poor warhearts and adventurers which tell of a return of the malefic tyrant to his ambitions. Some say that he might be orchestrating the recent cultist attacks in the lands of Craftia and Imperia. Whatever may happen, we are ready to stop this anthropophagy."
 tho.3.d: "The suffering. The Tears. The pain and sorrow. The sweat and blood of the believers in notchism, have all led up to this moment. We raised great structures, monuments and symbols to our mighty lord. We never lost his teachings and we have always certified to mantain him close to our hearts. We are fires of will, burning bright, individually in a grand circle, almost like a bonfire of dreams and hopes; bond together by our savior and our faith. \n \n Even with the persecution and threats of the evil echoes from the north, we have made it to the Holy Island at last. \n \n We are no longer but a Cultist Regime, we are a true Kingdom. The Kingdom of Emereth. The Holy Kingdom for which will last eternally. Notch is infinite. The World is infinite. All-encompassing, we will devout ourselves to carry his faith outwards and beyond. No amount of degenerate heresy and jealousness will make our conquests for god falter. AVE NOTCH!!!"
 tho.4.d: "The World is Suffering. The Sins and Cowards of the West have destroyed Harmony in the Old Order. The Empire of the Southern Players is but a husk of itself, Imperia's emperor is now but a mumbling old man and the Confederation is nearing collapse. The lack of order in the West has proven their unfortunate faith, truthfully a work of Herobrine. \n \n §RIn the East, everything has been completely corrupted... Anarchy Reigns.§! Herobrine has brought the prospering Kingdom into its downfall, being but a fallen and decaying corpse of order. The Monsters and Mobs thrive in this demonic hell. This lack of order too gave prospects for new empires. The Lytch King and the Enchanted Lands are competing to see who can take the East and replace the Fallen Kingdom. A true disgrace. \n \n As the believes of Notch, the Templars of the Holy land, the Crusaders of Faith, we are to defend what is holy with all we got; §R No matter what the cost.§!"
