 TWN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "ANARCHIA MAMA! The Wild North is the oldest anarchist state in all the overworld. Being ruled by a single mysterious entity named 'Hausemaster' or simply 'Hause', the Wild North strives in its de-centralized and trully anarchical form of ruling. Despite of the supposed freedom that comes with this life, dark humors tell tales of Hause's grasp growing ever so more authoritarian. What shall be of the north in its future?"
 #Events
 twn.1.d:0 "As the first communities in the overworld surged, our territories stood abandoned up north. For several decades, our current spot in the overworld was an abandoned wasteland. Said fact was true until several players, some of them specialized in PvP and survival came to the region in 78. The harsh environment and the dominant PvPer society caused the region to enter a state of constant warfare and ruin. Many clans forged alliances, commited to warfare and collapsed. There was no government. Anarchy reigned. \n \n For centuries, 'The Wild North', as it was and is called, stood that way. With a Brief Herobrine Occupation during the Unification War. \n \n The war left a sour taste in the mouth of the north, the warring clans were a shell-shocked bystander of the conflict, and said truth would culminate in what the Wild North is now. A Cabal? An Admin Intervention? Or just a local hegemony? A newborn faction in the Wild North, created a few years after the war, would through military prowess and political maneuvering take hold of the North. The 'Spawn Masons', a group formed by PvPers; scavengers and raiders from spawn. Supposedly, they'd marched from Devouring Plains all the way to The Wild North, settling in the former Village of 'Snowchester', for which they'd grief and make a new base in its foundations named 'Destroyed Spawn'. The group would come on to conquer, unite and destroy other factions from the north. They'd make their way to Brecutha Mountains within only 20 Years, vanishing the final factions in Cale Coast and today's Maelstrom Point with a decade. The Wild North had been united under the Spawn Masons, for whose ideology remained anarchist, in order to appease the players who had grown in the chaotic and lawless environment of the north. However, the Masons as a faction seemingly disappeared after 620, and before doing so, a mysterious leader for which little is known about took over, promising liberty and no greater overnment control as long as the people obeyed his commands. Is he a puppet? Is he in with the Masons? Is he part of a greater scheme? No one knows."
 twn.2.d:0 "The rise of the Spawn Masons has given the Wild North a farfetched concept of Union. With the advent of player survival, the north has been spoonfed ideas of nationalism and unity, relinquishing the anarchist ideals of the original players of this realm. While the older or more conservative of our players worry about this change, the new generations are starting to embrace it more and more. With Hausemaster being a mysterious figure and his moves unpredictable, we are not certain what will be of us in the future. \n \n Shall we betray our ancestors and elderly, striving for the dreams and wonders of a nation-state or may we continue living the ways of the old, in a government-less society, with a single figure overseeing us and keep the realm from collapse? No one knows."
 twn.3.d:0 "Hausemaster is a mysterious figure. Taking power right after the mysterious dissolution of the Spawn Masons, Hause has led the Wild North territories in the background, many times not being noticed by the population. His sole purpose is to mantain the Wild North a coherent territory and to prevent major chaos from happening, stopping the flow of anarchy into other regions. While the ideology taken by Hause is 'anarchical' and a govenrment figure doesn't quite exist, recently his authoritarian-like practices make it seem like something is happening in the background; that is when put in comparison to his history of having a laid-back approach in the Wild North. \n \n No one knows who he is, what is his age, what is his true name. His details are upheld in the Tower of Kinoko, Hausemaster's presumed residence and where he leads the Wild North. The area is heavily defended by his Private Militia, the Nerds Organization. God knows what happens in the tower."
 twn.4.d:0 "The side-effects of anarchy and Hause's history of laid-off control, have led to a series of events which have culminated to this. The north is split amongst several small warlords which have a hold of certain cities or communities in their respective states. Famous warlords include Dream, Technoblade, Skeppy, Tubbo, Sapnap, etc. These warlords, despite holding rivalries amongst each other collaborate in one way or another to protect anarchy and mantain the territories, giving protection and governing the communities for which they hold influence on. On a yearly basis, a meeting is held at L'manburg, a city controlled by one of the if not the most powerful warlord in the North; Dream. This meeting involves several Warlords and their cohorts sitting down and discussing affairs, territorial disputes, politics and miscellaneous or casual things. But, with the worrying change of how Hause leads, this year's meeting shall be one far different from the others. And Hause knows what will go down. \n \n Hause is architecting something in the darkness, from the top of his tower, he ponders his true and dark intentions of what to do with the north. Hearsays of L'manburg being put in lockdown or the Warlords being persecuted are surging amongst the ranks of the same and even among the population. The Warlords and Hause are ready for everything. Who shall win this political game?"
 twn.5.d:0 "As the Warlords arrived to L'manburg and started to commence their usual meeting, Hause made his moves. Weaponized Convoy Ships approached the shore of L'manburg, raising an eyebrow throughout the city. This suspicion would turn into conviction as several player militias, led by Hause himself, who is currently giving commands from his tower, started laying siege to the city. Hundreds of TNT where sent from above to below, as the streets were filled by explosions. Shots were fired and it seemed like the end. However, the Dream Corps have risen in several locations of the Wild North, de-stabilizing the military and even taking up arms and fighting back the siege, resisting Hause's agression. \n \n With this development of events, we may see a slow and grindy siege throughout L'manburg. Shall the Warlords and most importantly Dream survive the siege and take down Hause, or should Hause accomplish his true goals and do nefarious deeds to the Warlords. God Have mercy."
 twn.6.d:0 "Hause's forces, after months of fighting and trying to destroy our current territories, were defeated and slaughtered by the Warlords. We have stablished total control over the politics, with protests and the whole ordeal shedding a bad light on the man himself. We were able to send out an assault squadron out to kill Hausemaster and declare the end of the siege. When the squad had arrived at Kinoko Tower, the troops were absent, and Hause was already long gone, with no traces that he was even at the city to begin with. A Suicide? A escape attempt? No one knows. His escapade was as mysterious as he himself. \n \n However, we have found a few documents who were presumebly forgotten or not seized by Hause in his supposed dissapearance. Most of them are trite, but some link his birth to Kinoko and confirm the conspiracy that Hause indeed, was put in power by the Spawn Masons. That's the most the troops could find, the Spawn Masons' dissolution remains a secret and whatever happened to Hause is mistery. \n \n With the fall of Hausemaster, we can unite the Wild North under L'manburg an dream. We will finally bring an end to the era of warlordism and put forth the nation-state dazzles that have been circulating the nation for decades now."
 twn.7.d:0 "Months of siege, TNT pounding, smoke and ash, brang forth the collapse of L'manburg. §RThere is no room in hell not anymore§!, Dream's defeat was met with his death, and with his death we shall find a new future. My plans are great. My true dream will be accomplished. The cohorts and likes of dream have been all slaughtered; Antfrost, Awesamdude, Sapnap... They don't deserve a spot in the north. While some of them might be valuable pieces such as Techno and Mega, we cannot let people who think and act like dream take hold of the population. \n \n §R What I'm doing here is True Anarchy. None rules but anything can happen. I will do my all to give this place what I envision, this chaotic nature is part of what we preach and have been preaching for centuries.§! What the future upholds... my plans... I will accomplish my dream, whether the people like it or not."
 twn.8.d:0 "After the Siege of L'manburg, Hause has disappeared. With all the dead Warlords and no ruling figure to contain and rule the Anarchist north, the territories have fallen into havoc. With the separatism in every single region of the Wild North spurting, our collapse is imminent and unavoidable. \n \n In these jarring times, who shall we side with?"
